CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, вЂњand what is the use of a book,вЂќ thought Alice
вЂњwithout pictures or conversations?вЂќ

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, вЂњOh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!вЂќ (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled вЂњORANGE MARMALADEвЂќ, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

вЂњWell!вЂќ thought Alice to herself, вЂњafter such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyвЂ™ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldnвЂ™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!вЂќ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? вЂњI wonder how
many miles IвЂ™ve fallen by this time?вЂќ she said aloud. вЂњI must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I thinkвЂ”вЂќ (for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) вЂњвЂ”yes, thatвЂ™s about the right distanceвЂ”but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude IвЂ™ve got to?вЂќ (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. вЂњI wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny itвЂ™ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkвЂ”вЂќ (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnвЂ™t sound at all
the right word) вЂњвЂ”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, MaвЂ™am, is this New Zealand or Australia?вЂќ
(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeвЂ”fancy _curtseying_ as youвЂ™re
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) вЂњAnd what
an ignorant little girl sheвЂ™ll think me for asking! No, itвЂ™ll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.вЂќ

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. вЂњDinahвЂ™ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!вЂќ
(Dinah was the cat.) вЂњI hope theyвЂ™ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, IвЂ™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatвЂ™s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?вЂќ And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, вЂњDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?вЂќ and
sometimes, вЂњDo bats eat cats?вЂќ for, you see, as she couldnвЂ™t answer
either question, it didnвЂ™t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
вЂњNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?вЂќ when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, вЂњOh my ears
and whiskers, how late itвЂ™s getting!вЂќ She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and AliceвЂ™s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; вЂњand even if my head would go through,вЂќ thought
poor Alice, вЂњit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.вЂќ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (вЂњwhich certainly was not here
before,вЂќ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words вЂњDRINK ME,вЂќ beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say вЂњDrink me,вЂќ but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. вЂњNo, IвЂ™ll look first,вЂќ she said,
вЂњand see whether itвЂ™s marked вЂ_poison_вЂ™ or notвЂќ; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked вЂњpoison,вЂќ it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked вЂњpoison,вЂќ so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


вЂњWhat a curious feeling!вЂќ said Alice; вЂњI must be shutting up like a
telescope.вЂќ

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; вЂњfor it might end, you know,вЂќ
said Alice to herself, вЂњin my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?вЂќ And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

вЂњCome, thereвЂ™s no use in crying like that!вЂќ said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; вЂњI advise you to leave off this minute!вЂќ She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
вЂњBut itвЂ™s no use now,вЂќ thought poor Alice, вЂњto pretend to be two
people! Why, thereвЂ™s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!вЂќ

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
вЂњEAT MEвЂќ were beautifully marked in currants. вЂњWell, IвЂ™ll eat it,вЂќ said
Alice, вЂњand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way IвЂ™ll
get into the garden, and I donвЂ™t care which happens!вЂќ

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, вЂњWhich way? Which
way?вЂќ, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *




CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears


вЂњCuriouser and curiouser!вЂќ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); вЂњnow IвЂ™m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!вЂќ
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). вЂњOh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? IвЂ™m
sure _I_ shanвЂ™t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;вЂ”but I must be
kind to them,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњor perhaps they wonвЂ™t walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: IвЂ™ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.вЂќ

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. вЂњThey must
go by the carrier,вЂќ she thought; вЂњand how funny itвЂ™ll seem, sending
presents to oneвЂ™s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     _AliceвЂ™s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     AliceвЂ™s love_).

Oh dear, what nonsense IвЂ™m talking!вЂќ

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

вЂњYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњa great girl like
you,вЂќ (she might well say this), вЂњto go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!вЂќ But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, вЂњOh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! wonвЂ™t she be savage if IвЂ™ve kept her waiting!вЂќ Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, вЂњIf you please,
sirвЂ”вЂќ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: вЂњDear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if IвЂ™ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if IвЂ™m not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _thatвЂ™s_ the great puzzle!вЂќ And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

вЂњIвЂ™m sure IвЂ™m not Ada,вЂќ she said, вЂњfor her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesnвЂ™t go in ringlets at all; and IвЂ™m sure I canвЂ™t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _sheвЂ™s_ she, and _IвЂ™m_ I, andвЂ”oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! IвЂ™ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven isвЂ”oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnвЂ™t signify: letвЂ™s try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and RomeвЂ”no, _thatвЂ™s_ all wrong, IвЂ™m certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! IвЂ™ll try and say вЂ_How doth the little_вЂ”вЂ™вЂќ and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do:вЂ”

вЂњHow doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

вЂњHow cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!вЂќ


вЂњIвЂ™m sure those are not the right words,вЂќ said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, вЂњI must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, IвЂ™ve
made up my mind about it; if IвЂ™m Mabel, IвЂ™ll stay down here! ItвЂ™ll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying вЂCome up again, dear!вЂ™
I shall only look up and say вЂWho am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, IвЂ™ll come up: if not, IвЂ™ll stay down
here till IвЂ™m somebody elseвЂ™вЂ”but, oh dear!вЂќ cried Alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, вЂњI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!вЂќ

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the RabbitвЂ™s little white kid gloves while
she was talking. вЂњHow _can_ I have done that?вЂќ she thought. вЂњI must be
growing small again.вЂќ She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

вЂњThat _was_ a narrow escape!вЂќ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; вЂњand
now for the garden!вЂќ and she ran with all speed back to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, вЂњand things are worse than
ever,вЂќ thought the poor child, вЂњfor I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare itвЂ™s too bad, that it is!вЂќ

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, вЂњand in that case I can go back by
railway,вЂќ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

вЂњI wish I hadnвЂ™t cried so much!вЂќ said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. вЂњI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.вЂќ

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

вЂњWould it be of any use, now,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњto speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, thereвЂ™s no harm in trying.вЂќ So she
began: вЂњO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!вЂќ (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brotherвЂ™s Latin Grammar, вЂњA mouseвЂ”of
a mouseвЂ”to a mouseвЂ”a mouseвЂ”O mouse!вЂќ) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

вЂњPerhaps it doesnвЂ™t understand English,вЂќ thought Alice; вЂњI daresay itвЂ™s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.вЂќ (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: вЂњOГ№ est ma chatte?вЂќ which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. вЂњOh, I beg your pardon!вЂќ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animalвЂ™s feelings. вЂњI quite forgot you didnвЂ™t like
cats.вЂќ

вЂњNot like cats!вЂќ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. вЂњWould
_you_ like cats if you were me?вЂќ

вЂњWell, perhaps not,вЂќ said Alice in a soothing tone: вЂњdonвЂ™t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youвЂ™d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,вЂќ Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, вЂњand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her faceвЂ”and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurseвЂ”and sheвЂ™s such a capital one for catching miceвЂ”oh, I beg your
pardon!вЂќ cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. вЂњWe wonвЂ™t talk
about her any more if youвЂ™d rather not.вЂќ

вЂњWe indeed!вЂќ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. вЂњAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! DonвЂ™t let me hear the name
again!вЂќ

вЂњI wonвЂ™t indeed!вЂќ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. вЂњAre youвЂ”are you fondвЂ”ofвЂ”of dogs?вЂќ The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: вЂњThere is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itвЂ™ll fetch things when
you throw them, and itвЂ™ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of thingsвЂ”I canвЂ™t remember half of themвЂ”and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says itвЂ™s so useful, itвЂ™s worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats andвЂ”oh dear!вЂќ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
вЂњIвЂ™m afraid IвЂ™ve offended it again!вЂќ For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, вЂњMouse dear! Do come back again, and we
wonвЂ™t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donвЂ™t like them!вЂќ When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, вЂњLet us get to the shore, and then IвЂ™ll tell you my
history, and youвЂ™ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.вЂќ

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankвЂ”the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, вЂњI am
older than you, and must know better;вЂќ and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, вЂњSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _IвЂ™ll_ soon make
you dry enough!вЂќ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

вЂњAhem!вЂќ said the Mouse with an important air, вЂњare you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! вЂWilliam
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and NorthumbriaвЂ”вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњUgh!вЂќ said the Lory, with a shiver.

вЂњI beg your pardon!вЂќ said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: вЂњDid
you speak?вЂќ

вЂњNot I!вЂќ said the Lory hastily.

вЂњI thought you did,вЂќ said the Mouse. вЂњвЂ”I proceed. вЂEdwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisableвЂ”вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњFound _what_?вЂќ said the Duck.

вЂњFound _it_,вЂќ the Mouse replied rather crossly: вЂњof course you know
what вЂitвЂ™ means.вЂќ

вЂњI know what вЂitвЂ™ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,вЂќ said the
Duck: вЂњitвЂ™s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?вЂќ

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, вЂњвЂвЂ”found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. WilliamвЂ™s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his NormansвЂ”вЂ™ How are you getting on now, my dear?вЂќ it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.

вЂњAs wet as ever,вЂќ said Alice in a melancholy tone: вЂњit doesnвЂ™t seem to
dry me at all.вЂќ

вЂњIn that case,вЂќ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, вЂњI move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remediesвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSpeak English!вЂќ said the Eaglet. вЂњI donвЂ™t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, whatвЂ™s more, I donвЂ™t believe you do either!вЂќ And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

вЂњWhat I was going to say,вЂќ said the Dodo in an offended tone, вЂњwas,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.вЂќ

вЂњWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?вЂќ said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

вЂњWhy,вЂќ said the Dodo, вЂњthe best way to explain it is to do it.вЂќ (And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (вЂњthe exact
shape doesnвЂ™t matter,вЂќ it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no вЂњOne, two, three, and
away,вЂќ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out вЂњThe race is over!вЂќ and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, вЂњBut who has won?вЂќ

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, вЂњ_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.вЂќ

вЂњBut who is to give the prizes?вЂќ quite a chorus of voices asked.

вЂњWhy, _she_, of course,вЂќ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, вЂњPrizes! Prizes!вЂќ

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.

вЂњBut she must have a prize herself, you know,вЂќ said the Mouse.

вЂњOf course,вЂќ the Dodo replied very gravely. вЂњWhat else have you got in
your pocket?вЂќ he went on, turning to Alice.

вЂњOnly a thimble,вЂќ said Alice sadly.

вЂњHand it over here,вЂќ said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying вЂњWe beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;вЂќ and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

вЂњYou promised to tell me your history, you know,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњand why
it is you hateвЂ”C and D,вЂќ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

вЂњMine is a long and a sad tale!вЂќ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

вЂњIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,вЂќ said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the MouseвЂ™s tail; вЂњbut why do you call it sad?вЂќ And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:вЂ”

         вЂњFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, вЂLet us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.вЂ”Come, IвЂ™ll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning IвЂ™ve
         nothing to do.вЂ™ Said the mouse to the cur, вЂSuch a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.вЂ™
         вЂIвЂ™ll be judge, IвЂ™ll be jury,вЂ™ Said cunning old Fury: вЂIвЂ™ll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњYou are not attending!вЂќ said the Mouse to Alice severely. вЂњWhat are
you thinking of?вЂќ

вЂњI beg your pardon,вЂќ said Alice very humbly: вЂњyou had got to the fifth
bend, I think?вЂќ

вЂњI had _not!_вЂќ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

вЂњA knot!вЂќ said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. вЂњOh, do let me help to undo it!вЂќ

вЂњI shall do nothing of the sort,вЂќ said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. вЂњYou insult me by talking such nonsense!вЂќ

вЂњI didnвЂ™t mean it!вЂќ pleaded poor Alice. вЂњBut youвЂ™re so easily offended,
you know!вЂќ

The Mouse only growled in reply.

вЂњPlease come back and finish your story!вЂќ Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, вЂњYes, please do!вЂќ but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

вЂњWhat a pity it wouldnвЂ™t stay!вЂќ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter вЂњAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!вЂќ вЂњHold your tongue, Ma!вЂќ said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. вЂњYouвЂ™re enough to try the patience of an oyster!вЂќ

вЂњI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!вЂќ said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. вЂњSheвЂ™d soon fetch it back!вЂќ

вЂњAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?вЂќ said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
вЂњDinahвЂ™s our cat. And sheвЂ™s such a capital one for catching mice you
canвЂ™t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
sheвЂ™ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!вЂќ

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, вЂњI really must be getting home; the night-air
doesnвЂ™t suit my throat!вЂќ and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, вЂњCome away, my dears! ItвЂ™s high time you were all in
bed!вЂќ On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.

вЂњI wish I hadnвЂ™t mentioned Dinah!вЂќ she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. вЂњNobody seems to like her, down here, and IвЂ™m sure sheвЂ™s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!вЂќ And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself вЂњThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! SheвЂ™ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?вЂќ Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seenвЂ”everything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, вЂњWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!вЂќ And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.

вЂњHe took me for his housemaid,вЂќ she said to herself as she ran. вЂњHow
surprised heвЂ™ll be when he finds out who I am! But IвЂ™d better take him
his fan and glovesвЂ”that is, if I can find them.вЂќ As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name вЂњW. RABBIT,вЂќ engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

вЂњHow queer it seems,вЂќ Alice said to herself, вЂњto be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose DinahвЂ™ll be sending me on messages next!вЂќ And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: вЂњвЂMiss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!вЂ™ вЂComing in a minute,
nurse! But IвЂ™ve got to see that the mouse doesnвЂ™t get out.вЂ™ Only I
donвЂ™t think,вЂќ Alice went on, вЂњthat theyвЂ™d let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!вЂќ

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words вЂњDRINK ME,вЂќ but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. вЂњI know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,вЂќ she said to herself, вЂњwhenever I eat or drink anything; so
IвЂ™ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itвЂ™ll make me grow large
again, for really IвЂ™m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!вЂќ

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself вЂњThatвЂ™s quite enoughвЂ”I hope I shanвЂ™t
grow any moreвЂ”As it is, I canвЂ™t get out at the doorвЂ”I do wish I hadnвЂ™t
drunk quite so much!вЂќ

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself вЂњNow I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?вЂќ

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

вЂњIt was much pleasanter at home,вЂќ thought poor Alice, вЂњwhen one wasnвЂ™t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadnвЂ™t gone down that rabbit-holeвЂ”and yetвЂ”and
yetвЂ”itвЂ™s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, IвЂ™ll write oneвЂ”but IвЂ™m grown up now,вЂќ she added in a
sorrowful tone; вЂњat least thereвЂ™s no room to grow up any more _here_.вЂќ

вЂњBut then,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњshall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? ThatвЂ™ll be a comfort, one wayвЂ”never to be an old womanвЂ”but
thenвЂ”always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnвЂ™t like _that!_вЂќ

вЂњOh, you foolish Alice!вЂќ she answered herself. вЂњHow can you learn
lessons in here? Why, thereвЂ™s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!вЂќ

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

вЂњMary Ann! Mary Ann!вЂќ said the voice. вЂњFetch me my gloves this moment!вЂќ
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and AliceвЂ™s elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself вЂњThen IвЂ™ll
go round and get in at the window.вЂќ

вЂњ_That_ you wonвЂ™t!вЂќ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voiceвЂ”the RabbitвЂ™sвЂ”вЂњPat! Pat! Where are you?вЂќ And
then a voice she had never heard before, вЂњSure then IвЂ™m here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!вЂќ

вЂњDigging for apples, indeed!вЂќ said the Rabbit angrily. вЂњHere! Come and
help me out of _this!_вЂќ (Sounds of more broken glass.)

вЂњNow tell me, Pat, whatвЂ™s that in the window?вЂќ

вЂњSure, itвЂ™s an arm, yer honour!вЂќ (He pronounced it вЂњarrum.вЂќ)

вЂњAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!вЂќ

вЂњSure, it does, yer honour: but itвЂ™s an arm for all that.вЂќ

вЂњWell, itвЂ™s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!вЂќ

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, вЂњSure, I donвЂ™t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!вЂќ вЂњDo as I tell you, you coward!вЂќ and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. вЂњWhat a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!вЂќ thought Alice. вЂњI wonder what
theyвЂ™ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ IвЂ™m sure _I_ donвЂ™t want to stay in here any longer!вЂќ

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: вЂњWhereвЂ™s the other
ladder?вЂ”Why, I hadnвЂ™t to bring but one; BillвЂ™s got the otherвЂ”Bill!
fetch it here, lad!вЂ”Here, put вЂ™em up at this cornerвЂ”No, tie вЂ™em
together firstвЂ”they donвЂ™t reach half high enough yetвЂ”Oh! theyвЂ™ll do
well enough; donвЂ™t be particularвЂ”Here, Bill! catch hold of this
ropeвЂ”Will the roof bear?вЂ”Mind that loose slateвЂ”Oh, itвЂ™s coming down!
Heads below!вЂќ (a loud crash)вЂ”вЂњNow, who did that?вЂ”It was Bill, I
fancyвЂ”WhoвЂ™s to go down the chimney?вЂ”Nay, _I_ shanвЂ™t! _You_ do
it!вЂ”_That_ I wonвЂ™t, then!вЂ”BillвЂ™s to go downвЂ”Here, Bill! the master says
youвЂ™re to go down the chimney!вЂќ

вЂњOh! So BillвЂ™s got to come down the chimney, has he?вЂќ said Alice to
herself. вЂњShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnвЂ™t be in
BillвЂ™s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little!вЂќ

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldnвЂ™t guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself вЂњThis is Bill,вЂќ she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of вЂњThere goes Bill!вЂќ
then the RabbitвЂ™s voice alongвЂ”вЂњCatch him, you by the hedge!вЂќ then
silence, and then another confusion of voicesвЂ”вЂњHold up his headвЂ”Brandy
nowвЂ”DonвЂ™t choke himвЂ”How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!вЂќ

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (вЂњThatвЂ™s Bill,вЂќ thought
Alice,) вЂњWell, I hardly knowвЂ”No more, thank ye; IвЂ™m better nowвЂ”but IвЂ™m
a deal too flustered to tell youвЂ”all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!вЂќ

вЂњSo you did, old fellow!вЂќ said the others.

вЂњWe must burn the house down!вЂќ said the RabbitвЂ™s voice; and Alice
called out as loud as she could, вЂњIf you do, IвЂ™ll set Dinah at you!вЂќ

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, вЂњI
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyвЂ™d take the
roof off.вЂќ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, вЂњA barrowful will do, to begin with.вЂќ

вЂњA barrowful of _what?_вЂќ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. вЂњIвЂ™ll put a stop to
this,вЂќ she said to herself, and shouted out, вЂњYouвЂ™d better not do that
again!вЂќ which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. вЂњIf I eat one of these cakes,вЂќ she thought, вЂњitвЂ™s sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it canвЂ™t possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose.вЂќ

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

вЂњThe first thing IвЂ™ve got to do,вЂќ said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, вЂњis to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.вЂќ

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. вЂњPoor little
thing!вЂќ said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppyвЂ™s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

вЂњAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!вЂќ said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: вЂњI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifвЂ”if IвЂ™d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! IвЂ™d nearly forgotten that
IвЂ™ve got to grow up again! Let me seeвЂ”how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?вЂќ

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything
else.




CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar


The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

вЂњWho are _you?_вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, вЂњIвЂ”I hardly know, sir, just at presentвЂ”at least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.вЂќ

вЂњWhat do you mean by that?вЂќ said the Caterpillar sternly. вЂњExplain
yourself!вЂќ

вЂњI canвЂ™t explain _myself_, IвЂ™m afraid, sir,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњbecause IвЂ™m
not myself, you see.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t see,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњIвЂ™m afraid I canвЂ™t put it more clearly,вЂќ Alice replied very politely,
вЂњfor I canвЂ™t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.вЂќ

вЂњIt isnвЂ™t,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, perhaps you havenвЂ™t found it so yet,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњbut when you
have to turn into a chrysalisвЂ”you will some day, you knowвЂ”and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think youвЂ™ll feel it a little
queer, wonвЂ™t you?вЂќ

вЂњNot a bit,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњall I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.вЂќ

вЂњYou!вЂќ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. вЂњWho are _you?_вЂќ

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the CaterpillarвЂ™s making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, вЂњI
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.вЂќ

вЂњWhy?вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

вЂњCome back!вЂќ the Caterpillar called after her. вЂњIвЂ™ve something
important to say!вЂќ

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

вЂњKeep your temper,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњIs that all?вЂќ said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

вЂњNo,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, вЂњSo you
think youвЂ™re changed, do you?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m afraid I am, sir,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњI canвЂ™t remember things as I
usedвЂ”and I donвЂ™t keep the same size for ten minutes together!вЂќ

вЂњCanвЂ™t remember _what_ things?вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, IвЂ™ve tried to say вЂњHow doth the little busy bee,вЂќ but it all
came different!вЂќ Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

вЂњRepeat, вЂњ_You are old, Father William_,вЂ™вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:вЂ”

вЂњYou are old, Father William,вЂќ the young man said,
    вЂњAnd your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your headвЂ”
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?вЂќ

вЂњIn my youth,вЂќ Father William replied to his son,
    вЂњI feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that IвЂ™m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.вЂќ

вЂњYou are old,вЂќ said the youth, вЂњas I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the doorвЂ”
    Pray, what is the reason of that?вЂќ

вЂњIn my youth,вЂќ said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    вЂњI kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointmentвЂ”one shilling the boxвЂ”
    Allow me to sell you a couple?вЂќ

вЂњYou are old,вЂќ said the youth, вЂњand your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beakвЂ”
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?вЂќ

вЂњIn my youth,вЂќ said his father, вЂњI took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.вЂќ

вЂњYou are old,вЂќ said the youth, вЂњone would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseвЂ”
    What made you so awfully clever?вЂќ

вЂњI have answered three questions, and that is enough,вЂќ
    Said his father; вЂњdonвЂ™t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or IвЂ™ll kick you down stairs!вЂќ


вЂњThat is not said right,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњNot _quite_ right, IвЂ™m afraid,вЂќ said Alice, timidly; вЂњsome of the
words have got altered.вЂќ

вЂњIt is wrong from beginning to end,вЂќ said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

вЂњWhat size do you want to be?вЂќ it asked.

вЂњOh, IвЂ™m not particular as to size,вЂќ Alice hastily replied; вЂњonly one
doesnвЂ™t like changing so often, you know.вЂќ

вЂњI _donвЂ™t_ know,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

вЂњAre you content now?вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnвЂ™t
mind,вЂќ said Alice: вЂњthree inches is such a wretched height to be.вЂќ

вЂњIt is a very good height indeed!вЂќ said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

вЂњBut IвЂ™m not used to it!вЂќ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, вЂњI wish the creatures wouldnвЂ™t be so easily
offended!вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ll get used to it in time,вЂќ said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
вЂњOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.вЂќ

вЂњOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_вЂќ thought Alice to
herself.

вЂњOf the mushroom,вЂќ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

вЂњAnd now which is which?вЂќ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


вЂњCome, my headвЂ™s free at last!вЂќ said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

вЂњWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?вЂќ said Alice. вЂњAnd where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I canвЂ™t see you?вЂќ
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

вЂњSerpent!вЂќ screamed the Pigeon.

вЂњIвЂ™m _not_ a serpent!вЂќ said Alice indignantly. вЂњLet me alone!вЂќ

вЂњSerpent, I say again!вЂќ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, вЂњIвЂ™ve tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!вЂќ

вЂњI havenвЂ™t the least idea what youвЂ™re talking about,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњIвЂ™ve tried the roots of trees, and IвЂ™ve tried banks, and IвЂ™ve tried
hedges,вЂќ the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; вЂњbut those
serpents! ThereвЂ™s no pleasing them!вЂќ

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

вЂњAs if it wasnвЂ™t trouble enough hatching the eggs,вЂќ said the Pigeon;
вЂњbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
havenвЂ™t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m very sorry youвЂ™ve been annoyed,вЂќ said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

вЂњAnd just as IвЂ™d taken the highest tree in the wood,вЂќ continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, вЂњand just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!вЂќ

вЂњBut IвЂ™m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!вЂќ said Alice. вЂњIвЂ™m aвЂ”IвЂ™m aвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWell! _What_ are you?вЂќ said the Pigeon. вЂњI can see youвЂ™re trying to
invent something!вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ”IвЂ™m a little girl,вЂќ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

вЂњA likely story indeed!вЂќ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. вЂњIвЂ™ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! YouвЂ™re a serpent; and thereвЂ™s
no use denying it. I suppose youвЂ™ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!вЂќ

вЂњI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,вЂќ said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; вЂњbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t believe it,вЂќ said the Pigeon; вЂњbut if they do, why then
theyвЂ™re a kind of serpent, thatвЂ™s all I can say.вЂќ

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, вЂњYouвЂ™re
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether youвЂ™re a little girl or a serpent?вЂќ

вЂњIt matters a good deal to _me_,вЂќ said Alice hastily; вЂњbut IвЂ™m not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldnвЂ™t want
_yours_: I donвЂ™t like them raw.вЂќ

вЂњWell, be off, then!вЂќ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. вЂњCome, thereвЂ™s half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! IвЂ™m never sure what IвЂ™m
going to be, from one minute to another! However, IвЂ™ve got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenвЂ”how
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?вЂќ As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
вЂњWhoever lives there,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњitвЂ™ll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!вЂќ So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
woodвЂ”(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)вЂ”and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, вЂњFor the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.вЂќ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, вЂњFrom the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.вЂќ

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

вЂњThereвЂ™s no sort of use in knocking,вЂќ said the Footman, вЂњand that for
two reasons. First, because IвЂ™m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because theyвЂ™re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.вЂќ And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on withinвЂ”a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.

вЂњPlease, then,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњhow am I to get in?вЂќ

вЂњThere might be some sense in your knocking,вЂќ the Footman went on
without attending to her, вЂњif we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know.вЂќ He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. вЂњBut perhaps he canвЂ™t help it,вЂќ
she said to herself; вЂњhis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.вЂ”How am I to get in?вЂќ
she repeated, aloud.

вЂњI shall sit here,вЂќ the Footman remarked, вЂњtill tomorrowвЂ”вЂќ

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the FootmanвЂ™s head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

вЂњвЂ”or next day, maybe,вЂќ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

вЂњHow am I to get in?вЂќ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

вЂњ_Are_ you to get in at all?вЂќ said the Footman. вЂњThatвЂ™s the first
question, you know.вЂќ

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. вЂњItвЂ™s really
dreadful,вЂќ she muttered to herself, вЂњthe way all the creatures argue.
ItвЂ™s enough to drive one crazy!вЂќ

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. вЂњI shall sit here,вЂќ he said, вЂњon and off, for
days and days.вЂќ

вЂњBut what am _I_ to do?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњAnything you like,вЂќ said the Footman, and began whistling.

вЂњOh, thereвЂ™s no use in talking to him,вЂќ said Alice desperately: вЂњheвЂ™s
perfectly idiotic!вЂќ And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

вЂњThereвЂ™s certainly too much pepper in that soup!вЂќ Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a momentвЂ™s pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

вЂњPlease would you tell me,вЂќ said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, вЂњwhy
your cat grins like that?вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s a Cheshire cat,вЂќ said the Duchess, вЂњand thatвЂ™s why. Pig!вЂќ

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:вЂ”

вЂњI didnвЂ™t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didnвЂ™t
know that cats _could_ grin.вЂќ

вЂњThey all can,вЂќ said the Duchess; вЂњand most of вЂ™em do.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t know of any that do,вЂќ Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

вЂњYou donвЂ™t know much,вЂќ said the Duchess; вЂњand thatвЂ™s a fact.вЂќ

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the babyвЂ”the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

вЂњOh, _please_ mind what youвЂ™re doing!вЂќ cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. вЂњOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!вЂќ as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

вЂњIf everybody minded their own business,вЂќ the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, вЂњthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.вЂќ

вЂњWhich would _not_ be an advantage,вЂќ said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. вЂњJust
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axisвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњTalking of axes,вЂќ said the Duchess, вЂњchop off her head!вЂќ

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: вЂњTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? IвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњOh, donвЂ™t bother _me_,вЂќ said the Duchess; вЂњI never could abide
figures!вЂќ And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

вЂњSpeak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.вЂќ


CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):


вЂњWow! wow! wow!вЂќ


While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:вЂ”

вЂњI speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!вЂќ


CHORUS.


вЂњWow! wow! wow!вЂќ


вЂњHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!вЂќ the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. вЂњI must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,вЂќ and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
вЂњjust like a star-fish,вЂќ thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. вЂњIf I donвЂ™t take this child away with me,вЂќ
thought Alice, вЂњtheyвЂ™re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnвЂ™t it be
murder to leave it behind?вЂќ She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
вЂњDonвЂ™t grunt,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњthatвЂ™s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.вЂќ

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. вЂњBut perhaps it was only
sobbing,вЂќ she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.

No, there were no tears. вЂњIf youвЂ™re going to turn into a pig, my dear,вЂќ
said Alice, seriously, вЂњIвЂ™ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!вЂќ The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, вЂњNow, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?вЂќ when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. вЂњIf it had grown up,вЂќ she said to
herself, вЂњit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.вЂќ And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, вЂњif one only knew the right way to change themвЂ”вЂќ when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

вЂњCheshire Puss,вЂќ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. вЂњCome, itвЂ™s pleased so far,вЂќ thought Alice, and she went on.
вЂњWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?вЂќ

вЂњThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,вЂќ said the Cat.

вЂњI donвЂ™t much care whereвЂ”вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњThen it doesnвЂ™t matter which way you go,вЂќ said the Cat.

вЂњвЂ”so long as I get _somewhere_,вЂќ Alice added as an explanation.

вЂњOh, youвЂ™re sure to do that,вЂќ said the Cat, вЂњif you only walk long
enough.вЂќ

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. вЂњWhat sort of people live about here?вЂќ

вЂњIn _that_ direction,вЂќ the Cat said, waving its right paw round, вЂњlives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,вЂќ waving the other paw, вЂњlives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: theyвЂ™re both mad.вЂќ

вЂњBut I donвЂ™t want to go among mad people,вЂќ Alice remarked.

вЂњOh, you canвЂ™t help that,вЂќ said the Cat: вЂњweвЂ™re all mad here. IвЂ™m mad.
YouвЂ™re mad.вЂќ

вЂњHow do you know IвЂ™m mad?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњYou must be,вЂќ said the Cat, вЂњor you wouldnвЂ™t have come here.вЂќ

Alice didnвЂ™t think that proved it at all; however, she went on вЂњAnd how
do you know that youвЂ™re mad?вЂќ

вЂњTo begin with,вЂќ said the Cat, вЂњa dogвЂ™s not mad. You grant that?вЂќ

вЂњI suppose so,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњWell, then,вЂќ the Cat went on, вЂњyou see, a dog growls when itвЂ™s angry,
and wags its tail when itвЂ™s pleased. Now _I_ growl when IвЂ™m pleased,
and wag my tail when IвЂ™m angry. Therefore IвЂ™m mad.вЂќ

вЂњ_I_ call it purring, not growling,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњCall it what you like,вЂќ said the Cat. вЂњDo you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?вЂќ

вЂњI should like it very much,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњbut I havenвЂ™t been invited
yet.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ll see me there,вЂќ said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

вЂњBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?вЂќ said the Cat. вЂњIвЂ™d nearly
forgotten to ask.вЂќ

вЂњIt turned into a pig,вЂќ Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

вЂњI thought it would,вЂќ said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. вЂњIвЂ™ve seen hatters before,вЂќ she
said to herself; вЂњthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it wonвЂ™t be raving madвЂ”at least not so mad as it
was in March.вЂќ As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

вЂњDid you say pig, or fig?вЂќ said the Cat.

вЂњI said pig,вЂќ replied Alice; вЂњand I wish you wouldnвЂ™t keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.вЂќ

вЂњAll right,вЂќ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

вЂњWell! IвЂ™ve often seen a cat without a grin,вЂќ thought Alice; вЂњbut a
grin without a cat! ItвЂ™s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!вЂќ

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself вЂњSuppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish IвЂ™d gone to see the Hatter instead!вЂќ




CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. вЂњVery
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,вЂќ thought Alice; вЂњonly, as itвЂ™s asleep,
I suppose it doesnвЂ™t mind.вЂќ

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: вЂњNo room! No room!вЂќ they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. вЂњThereвЂ™s _plenty_ of room!вЂќ said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

вЂњHave some wine,вЂќ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
вЂњI donвЂ™t see any wine,вЂќ she remarked.

вЂњThere isnвЂ™t any,вЂќ said the March Hare.

вЂњThen it wasnвЂ™t very civil of you to offer it,вЂќ said Alice angrily.

вЂњIt wasnвЂ™t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,вЂќ said
the March Hare.

вЂњI didnвЂ™t know it was _your_ table,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњitвЂ™s laid for a great
many more than three.вЂќ

вЂњYour hair wants cutting,вЂќ said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.

вЂњYou should learn not to make personal remarks,вЂќ Alice said with some
severity; вЂњitвЂ™s very rude.вЂќ

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was, вЂњWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?вЂќ

вЂњCome, we shall have some fun now!вЂќ thought Alice. вЂњIвЂ™m glad theyвЂ™ve
begun asking riddles.вЂ”I believe I can guess that,вЂќ she added aloud.

вЂњDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?вЂќ said
the March Hare.

вЂњExactly so,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњThen you should say what you mean,вЂќ the March Hare went on.

вЂњI do,вЂќ Alice hastily replied; вЂњat leastвЂ”at least I mean what I
sayвЂ”thatвЂ™s the same thing, you know.вЂќ

вЂњNot the same thing a bit!вЂќ said the Hatter. вЂњYou might just as well
say that вЂI see what I eatвЂ™ is the same thing as вЂI eat what I seeвЂ™!вЂќ

вЂњYou might just as well say,вЂќ added the March Hare, вЂњthat вЂI like what
I getвЂ™ is the same thing as вЂI get what I likeвЂ™!вЂќ

вЂњYou might just as well say,вЂќ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, вЂњthat вЂI breathe when I sleepвЂ™ is the same thing
as вЂI sleep when I breatheвЂ™!вЂќ

вЂњIt _is_ the same thing with you,вЂќ said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasnвЂ™t much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. вЂњWhat day of the month
is it?вЂќ he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said вЂњThe fourth.вЂќ

вЂњTwo days wrong!вЂќ sighed the Hatter. вЂњI told you butter wouldnвЂ™t suit
the works!вЂќ he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

вЂњIt was the _best_ butter,вЂќ the March Hare meekly replied.

вЂњYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,вЂќ the Hatter grumbled:
вЂњyou shouldnвЂ™t have put it in with the bread-knife.вЂќ

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, вЂњIt was the _best_ butter,
you know.вЂќ

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. вЂњWhat a
funny watch!вЂќ she remarked. вЂњIt tells the day of the month, and doesnвЂ™t
tell what oвЂ™clock it is!вЂќ

вЂњWhy should it?вЂќ muttered the Hatter. вЂњDoes _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?вЂќ

вЂњOf course not,вЂќ Alice replied very readily: вЂњbut thatвЂ™s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.вЂќ

вЂњWhich is just the case with _mine_,вЂќ said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The HatterвЂ™s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. вЂњI donвЂ™t quite
understand you,вЂќ she said, as politely as she could.

вЂњThe Dormouse is asleep again,вЂќ said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, вЂњOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.вЂќ

вЂњHave you guessed the riddle yet?вЂќ the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

вЂњNo, I give it up,вЂќ Alice replied: вЂњwhatвЂ™s the answer?вЂќ

вЂњI havenвЂ™t the slightest idea,вЂќ said the Hatter.

вЂњNor I,вЂќ said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. вЂњI think you might do something better with the
time,вЂќ she said, вЂњthan waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.вЂќ

вЂњIf you knew Time as well as I do,вЂќ said the Hatter, вЂњyou wouldnвЂ™t talk
about wasting _it_. ItвЂ™s _him_.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t know what you mean,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњOf course you donвЂ™t!вЂќ the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. вЂњI dare say you never even spoke to Time!вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps not,вЂќ Alice cautiously replied: вЂњbut I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.вЂќ

вЂњAh! that accounts for it,вЂќ said the Hatter. вЂњHe wonвЂ™t stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heвЂ™d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oвЂ™clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: youвЂ™d only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!вЂќ

(вЂњI only wish it was,вЂќ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

вЂњThat would be grand, certainly,вЂќ said Alice thoughtfully: вЂњbut thenвЂ”I
shouldnвЂ™t be hungry for it, you know.вЂќ

вЂњNot at first, perhaps,вЂќ said the Hatter: вЂњbut you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.вЂќ

вЂњIs that the way _you_ manage?вЂќ Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. вЂњNot I!вЂќ he replied. вЂњWe
quarrelled last MarchвЂ”just before _he_ went mad, you knowвЂ”вЂќ (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) вЂњвЂ”it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

вЂTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what youвЂ™re at!вЂ™


You know the song, perhaps?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ve heard something like it,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњIt goes on, you know,вЂќ the Hatter continued, вЂњin this way:вЂ”

вЂUp above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkleвЂ”вЂ™вЂќ


Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
вЂњ_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_вЂ”вЂќ and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.

вЂњWell, IвЂ™d hardly finished the first verse,вЂќ said the Hatter, вЂњwhen the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, вЂHeвЂ™s murdering the time! Off with his
head!вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњHow dreadfully savage!вЂќ exclaimed Alice.

вЂњAnd ever since that,вЂќ the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, вЂњhe wonвЂ™t
do a thing I ask! ItвЂ™s always six oвЂ™clock now.вЂќ

A bright idea came into AliceвЂ™s head. вЂњIs that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?вЂќ she asked.

вЂњYes, thatвЂ™s it,вЂќ said the Hatter with a sigh: вЂњitвЂ™s always tea-time,
and weвЂ™ve no time to wash the things between whiles.вЂќ

вЂњThen you keep moving round, I suppose?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњExactly so,вЂќ said the Hatter: вЂњas the things get used up.вЂќ

вЂњBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?вЂќ Alice ventured
to ask.

вЂњSuppose we change the subject,вЂќ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
вЂњIвЂ™m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m afraid I donвЂ™t know one,вЂќ said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

вЂњThen the Dormouse shall!вЂќ they both cried. вЂњWake up, Dormouse!вЂќ And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. вЂњI wasnвЂ™t asleep,вЂќ he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: вЂњI heard every word you fellows were saying.вЂќ

вЂњTell us a story!вЂќ said the March Hare.

вЂњYes, please do!вЂќ pleaded Alice.

вЂњAnd be quick about it,вЂќ added the Hatter, вЂњor youвЂ™ll be asleep again
before itвЂ™s done.вЂќ

вЂњOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,вЂќ the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; вЂњand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a wellвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhat did they live on?вЂќ said Alice, who always took a great interest
in questions of eating and drinking.

вЂњThey lived on treacle,вЂќ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

вЂњThey couldnвЂ™t have done that, you know,вЂќ Alice gently remarked;
вЂњtheyвЂ™d have been ill.вЂќ

вЂњSo they were,вЂќ said the Dormouse; вЂњ_very_ ill.вЂќ

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: вЂњBut
why did they live at the bottom of a well?вЂќ

вЂњTake some more tea,вЂќ the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

вЂњIвЂ™ve had nothing yet,вЂќ Alice replied in an offended tone, вЂњso I canвЂ™t
take more.вЂќ

вЂњYou mean you canвЂ™t take _less_,вЂќ said the Hatter: вЂњitвЂ™s very easy to
take _more_ than nothing.вЂќ

вЂњNobody asked _your_ opinion,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњWhoвЂ™s making personal remarks now?вЂќ the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. вЂњWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?вЂќ

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, вЂњIt was a treacle-well.вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s no such thing!вЂќ Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went вЂњSh! sh!вЂќ and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, вЂњIf you canвЂ™t be civil, youвЂ™d better finish the story for
yourself.вЂќ

вЂњNo, please go on!вЂќ Alice said very humbly; вЂњI wonвЂ™t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_.вЂќ

вЂњOne, indeed!вЂќ said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. вЂњAnd so these three little sistersвЂ”they were learning to draw,
you knowвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhat did they draw?вЂќ said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

вЂњTreacle,вЂќ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

вЂњI want a clean cup,вЂќ interrupted the Hatter: вЂњletвЂ™s all move one place
on.вЂќ

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the DormouseвЂ™s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: вЂњBut I donвЂ™t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?вЂќ

вЂњYou can draw water out of a water-well,вЂќ said the Hatter; вЂњso I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-wellвЂ”eh, stupid?вЂќ

вЂњBut they were _in_ the well,вЂќ Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark.

вЂњOf course they were,вЂќ said the Dormouse; вЂњвЂ”well in.вЂќ

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

вЂњThey were learning to draw,вЂќ the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; вЂњand they drew all manner of
thingsвЂ”everything that begins with an MвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhy with an M?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњWhy not?вЂќ said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: вЂњвЂ”that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessвЂ”you know you say
things are вЂњmuch of a muchnessвЂќвЂ”did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?вЂќ

вЂњReally, now you ask me,вЂќ said Alice, very much confused, вЂњI donвЂ™t
thinkвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThen you shouldnвЂ™t talk,вЂќ said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

вЂњAt any rate IвЂ™ll never go _there_ again!вЂќ said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. вЂњItвЂ™s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!вЂќ

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. вЂњThatвЂ™s very curious!вЂќ she thought. вЂњBut
everythingвЂ™s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.вЂќ And
in she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. вЂњNow, IвЂ™ll manage better this time,вЂќ she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_вЂ”she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
and the cool fountains.




CHAPTER VIII.
The QueenвЂ™s Croquet-Ground


A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, вЂњLook out now, Five! DonвЂ™t go splashing paint over me
like that!вЂќ

вЂњI couldnвЂ™t help it,вЂќ said Five, in a sulky tone; вЂњSeven jogged my
elbow.вЂќ

On which Seven looked up and said, вЂњThatвЂ™s right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!вЂќ

вЂњ_YouвЂ™d_ better not talk!вЂќ said Five. вЂњI heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!вЂќ

вЂњWhat for?вЂќ said the one who had spoken first.

вЂњThatвЂ™s none of _your_ business, Two!вЂќ said Seven.

вЂњYes, it _is_ his business!вЂќ said Five, вЂњand IвЂ™ll tell himвЂ”it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.вЂќ

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun вЂњWell, of all the unjust
thingsвЂ”вЂќ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.

вЂњWould you tell me,вЂќ said Alice, a little timidly, вЂњwhy you are
painting those roses?вЂќ

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, вЂњWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, weвЂ™re doing our best, afore she comes, toвЂ”вЂќ At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out вЂњThe Queen! The Queen!вЂќ and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
the KingвЂ™s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; вЂњand besides, what would be the use of a
procession,вЂќ thought she, вЂњif people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldnвЂ™t see it?вЂќ So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely вЂњWho is this?вЂќ She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

вЂњIdiot!вЂќ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, вЂњWhatвЂ™s your name, child?вЂќ

вЂњMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,вЂќ said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, вЂњWhy, theyвЂ™re only a pack of cards, after
all. I neednвЂ™t be afraid of them!вЂќ

вЂњAnd who are _these?_вЂќ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.

вЂњHow should _I_ know?вЂќ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. вЂњItвЂ™s
no business of _mine_.вЂќ

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed вЂњOff with her head! OffвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњNonsense!вЂќ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said вЂњConsider, my
dear: she is only a child!вЂќ

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave вЂњTurn
them over!вЂќ

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

вЂњGet up!вЂќ said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

вЂњLeave off that!вЂќ screamed the Queen. вЂњYou make me giddy.вЂќ And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, вЂњWhat _have_ you been doing
here?вЂќ

вЂњMay it please your Majesty,вЂќ said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, вЂњwe were tryingвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњ_I_ see!вЂќ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
вЂњOff with their heads!вЂќ and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

вЂњYou shanвЂ™t be beheaded!вЂќ said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

вЂњAre their heads off?вЂќ shouted the Queen.

вЂњTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!вЂќ the soldiers shouted
in reply.

вЂњThatвЂ™s right!вЂќ shouted the Queen. вЂњCan you play croquet?вЂќ

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

вЂњYes!вЂќ shouted Alice.

вЂњCome on, then!вЂќ roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

вЂњItвЂ™sвЂ”itвЂ™s a very fine day!вЂќ said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

вЂњVery,вЂќ said Alice: вЂњвЂ”whereвЂ™s the Duchess?вЂќ

вЂњHush! Hush!вЂќ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered вЂњSheвЂ™s under
sentence of execution.вЂќ

вЂњWhat for?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњDid you say вЂWhat a pity!вЂ™?вЂќ the Rabbit asked.

вЂњNo, I didnвЂ™t,вЂќ said Alice: вЂњI donвЂ™t think itвЂ™s at all a pity. I said
вЂWhat for?вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњShe boxed the QueenвЂ™s earsвЂ”вЂќ the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. вЂњOh, hush!вЂќ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. вЂњThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen saidвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњGet to your places!вЂќ shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting вЂњOff with his head!вЂќ or вЂњOff with her head!вЂќ about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
вЂњand then,вЂќ thought she, вЂњwhat would become of me? TheyвЂ™re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that thereвЂ™s any
one left alive!вЂќ

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself вЂњItвЂ™s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to.вЂќ

вЂњHow are you getting on?вЂќ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. вЂњItвЂ™s no use
speaking to it,вЂќ she thought, вЂњtill its ears have come, or at least one
of them.вЂќ In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

вЂњI donвЂ™t think they play at all fairly,вЂќ Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, вЂњand they all quarrel so dreadfully one canвЂ™t hear
oneself speakвЂ”and they donвЂ™t seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to themвЂ”and youвЂ™ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, thereвЂ™s the
arch IвЂ™ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
groundвЂ”and I should have croqueted the QueenвЂ™s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!вЂќ

вЂњHow do you like the Queen?вЂќ said the Cat in a low voice.

вЂњNot at all,вЂќ said Alice: вЂњsheвЂ™s so extremelyвЂ”вЂќ Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
вЂњвЂ”likely to win, that itвЂ™s hardly worth while finishing the game.вЂќ

The Queen smiled and passed on.

вЂњWho _are_ you talking to?вЂќ said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the CatвЂ™s head with great curiosity.

вЂњItвЂ™s a friend of mineвЂ”a Cheshire Cat,вЂќ said Alice: вЂњallow me to
introduce it.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t like the look of it at all,вЂќ said the King: вЂњhowever, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d rather not,вЂќ the Cat remarked.

вЂњDonвЂ™t be impertinent,вЂќ said the King, вЂњand donвЂ™t look at me like
that!вЂќ He got behind Alice as he spoke.

вЂњA cat may look at a king,вЂќ said Alice. вЂњIвЂ™ve read that in some book,
but I donвЂ™t remember where.вЂќ

вЂњWell, it must be removed,вЂќ said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, вЂњMy dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!вЂќ

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. вЂњOff with his head!вЂќ she said, without even looking round.

вЂњIвЂ™ll fetch the executioner myself,вЂќ said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the QueenвЂ™s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: вЂњbut it doesnвЂ™t
matter much,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњas all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.вЂќ So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executionerвЂ™s argument was, that you couldnвЂ™t cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasnвЂ™t going to begin at _his_ time of life.

The KingвЂ™s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you werenвЂ™t to talk nonsense.

The QueenвЂ™s argument was, that if something wasnвЂ™t done about it in
less than no time sheвЂ™d have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but вЂњIt belongs to the
Duchess: youвЂ™d better ask _her_ about it.вЂќ

вЂњSheвЂ™s in prison,вЂќ the Queen said to the executioner: вЂњfetch her here.вЂќ
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The CatвЂ™s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX.
The Mock TurtleвЂ™s Story


вЂњYou canвЂ™t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!вЂќ
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into AliceвЂ™s,
and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

вЂњWhen _IвЂ™m_ a Duchess,вЂќ she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), вЂњI wonвЂ™t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well withoutвЂ”Maybe itвЂ™s always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,вЂќ she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, вЂњand vinegar that makes them sourвЂ”and camomile that makes
them bitterвЂ”andвЂ”and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldnвЂ™t be
so stingy about it, you knowвЂ”вЂќ

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. вЂњYouвЂ™re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I canвЂ™t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps it hasnвЂ™t one,вЂќ Alice ventured to remark.

вЂњTut, tut, child!вЂќ said the Duchess. вЂњEverythingвЂ™s got a moral, if only
you can find it.вЂќ And she squeezed herself up closer to AliceвЂ™s side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon AliceвЂ™s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

вЂњThe gameвЂ™s going on rather better now,вЂќ she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

вЂњвЂ™Tis so,вЂќ said the Duchess: вЂњand the moral of that isвЂ”вЂOh, вЂ™tis love,
вЂ™tis love, that makes the world go round!вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњSomebody said,вЂќ Alice whispered, вЂњthat itвЂ™s done by everybody minding
their own business!вЂќ

вЂњAh, well! It means much the same thing,вЂќ said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into AliceвЂ™s shoulder as she added, вЂњand the moral of
_that_ isвЂ”вЂTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњHow fond she is of finding morals in things!вЂќ Alice thought to
herself.

вЂњI dare say youвЂ™re wondering why I donвЂ™t put my arm round your waist,вЂќ
the Duchess said after a pause: вЂњthe reason is, that IвЂ™m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?вЂќ

вЂњHe might bite,вЂќ Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

вЂњVery true,вЂќ said the Duchess: вЂњflamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that isвЂ”вЂBirds of a feather flock together.вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњOnly mustard isnвЂ™t a bird,вЂќ Alice remarked.

вЂњRight, as usual,вЂќ said the Duchess: вЂњwhat a clear way you have of
putting things!вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s a mineral, I _think_,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњOf course it is,вЂќ said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; вЂњthereвЂ™s a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that isвЂ”вЂThe more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњOh, I know!вЂќ exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, вЂњitвЂ™s a vegetable. It doesnвЂ™t look like one, but it is.вЂќ

вЂњI quite agree with you,вЂќ said the Duchess; вЂњand the moral of that
isвЂ”вЂBe what you would seem to beвЂ™вЂ”or if youвЂ™d like it put more
simplyвЂ”вЂNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњI think I should understand that better,вЂќ Alice said very politely,
вЂњif I had it written down: but I canвЂ™t quite follow it as you say it.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s nothing to what I could say if I chose,вЂќ the Duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.

вЂњPray donвЂ™t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,вЂќ said
Alice.

вЂњOh, donвЂ™t talk about trouble!вЂќ said the Duchess. вЂњI make you a present
of everything IвЂ™ve said as yet.вЂќ

вЂњA cheap sort of present!вЂќ thought Alice. вЂњIвЂ™m glad they donвЂ™t give
birthday presents like that!вЂќ But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

вЂњThinking again?вЂќ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

вЂњIвЂ™ve a right to think,вЂќ said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

вЂњJust about as much right,вЂќ said the Duchess, вЂњas pigs have to fly; and
the mвЂ”вЂќ

But here, to AliceвЂ™s great surprise, the DuchessвЂ™s voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word вЂmoral,вЂ™ and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.

вЂњA fine day, your Majesty!вЂќ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

вЂњNow, I give you fair warning,вЂќ shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; вЂњeither you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!вЂќ

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

вЂњLetвЂ™s go on with the game,вЂќ the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the QueenвЂ™s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a momentвЂ™s delay
would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting вЂњOff with his head!вЂќ or вЂњOff with
her head!вЂќ Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, вЂњHave
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ said Alice. вЂњI donвЂ™t even know what a Mock Turtle is.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,вЂќ said the Queen.

вЂњI never saw one, or heard of one,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњCome on, then,вЂќ said the Queen, вЂњand he shall tell you his history,вЂќ

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, вЂњYou are all pardoned.вЂќ вЂњCome, _thatвЂ™s_ a
good thing!вЂќ she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
you donвЂ™t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) вЂњUp, lazy
thing!вЂќ said the Queen, вЂњand take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;вЂќ and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. вЂњWhat fun!вЂќ said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

вЂњWhat _is_ the fun?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњWhy, _she_,вЂќ said the Gryphon. вЂњItвЂ™s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!вЂќ

вЂњEverybody says вЂcome on!вЂ™ here,вЂќ thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: вЂњI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!вЂќ

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. вЂњWhat is his sorrow?вЂќ she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, вЂњItвЂ™s all
his fancy, that: he hasnвЂ™t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!вЂќ

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

вЂњThis here young lady,вЂќ said the Gryphon, вЂњshe wants for to know your
history, she do.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll tell it her,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: вЂњsit
down, both of you, and donвЂ™t speak a word till IвЂ™ve finished.вЂќ

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, вЂњI donвЂ™t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnвЂ™t begin.вЂќ
But she waited patiently.

вЂњOnce,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, вЂњI was a real
Turtle.вЂќ

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of вЂњHjckrrh!вЂќ from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, вЂњThank you, sir, for your interesting story,вЂќ but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

вЂњWhen we were little,вЂќ the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, вЂњwe went to school in the
sea. The master was an old TurtleвЂ”we used to call him TortoiseвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnвЂ™t one?вЂќ Alice asked.

вЂњWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle
angrily: вЂњreally you are very dull!вЂќ

вЂњYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,вЂќ added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, вЂњDrive on, old fellow! DonвЂ™t be all
day about it!вЂќ and he went on in these words:

вЂњYes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynвЂ™t believe itвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI never said I didnвЂ™t!вЂќ interrupted Alice.

вЂњYou did,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle.

вЂњHold your tongue!вЂќ added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

вЂњWe had the best of educationsвЂ”in fact, we went to school every dayвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњ_IвЂ™ve_ been to a day-school, too,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњyou neednвЂ™t be so
proud as all that.вЂќ

вЂњWith extras?вЂќ asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

вЂњYes,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњwe learned French and music.вЂќ

вЂњAnd washing?вЂќ said the Mock Turtle.

вЂњCertainly not!вЂќ said Alice indignantly.

вЂњAh! then yours wasnвЂ™t a really good school,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. вЂњNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
вЂFrench, music, _and washing_вЂ”extra.вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњYou couldnвЂ™t have wanted it much,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњliving at the bottom
of the sea.вЂќ

вЂњI couldnвЂ™t afford to learn it.вЂќ said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. вЂњI
only took the regular course.вЂќ

вЂњWhat was that?вЂќ inquired Alice.

вЂњReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,вЂќ the Mock Turtle
replied; вЂњand then the different branches of ArithmeticвЂ”Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.вЂќ

вЂњI never heard of вЂUglification,вЂ™вЂќ Alice ventured to say. вЂњWhat is it?вЂќ

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. вЂњWhat! Never heard of
uglifying!вЂќ it exclaimed. вЂњYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ said Alice doubtfully: вЂњit meansвЂ”toвЂ”makeвЂ”anythingвЂ”prettier.вЂќ

вЂњWell, then,вЂќ the Gryphon went on, вЂњif you donвЂ™t know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.вЂќ

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said вЂњWhat else had you to learn?вЂќ

вЂњWell, there was Mystery,вЂќ the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, вЂњвЂ”Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then DrawlingвЂ”the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.вЂќ

вЂњWhat was _that_ like?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњWell, I canвЂ™t show it you myself,вЂќ the Mock Turtle said: вЂњIвЂ™m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.вЂќ

вЂњHadnвЂ™t time,вЂќ said the Gryphon: вЂњI went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.вЂќ

вЂњI never went to him,вЂќ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: вЂњhe taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.вЂќ

вЂњSo he did, so he did,вЂќ said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

вЂњAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?вЂќ said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.

вЂњTen hours the first day,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle: вЂњnine the next, and so
on.вЂќ

вЂњWhat a curious plan!вЂќ exclaimed Alice.

вЂњThatвЂ™s the reason theyвЂ™re called lessons,вЂќ the Gryphon remarked:
вЂњbecause they lessen from day to day.вЂќ

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. вЂњThen the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?вЂќ

вЂњOf course it was,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle.

вЂњAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?вЂќ Alice went on eagerly.

вЂњThatвЂ™s enough about lessons,вЂќ the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: вЂњtell her something about the games now.вЂќ




CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille


The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. вЂњSame as if he had a bone in his throat,вЂќ
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:вЂ”

вЂњYou may not have lived much under the seaвЂ”вЂќ (вЂњI havenвЂ™t,вЂќ said
Alice)вЂ”вЂњand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsterвЂ”вЂќ
(Alice began to say вЂњI once tastedвЂ”вЂќ but checked herself hastily, and
said вЂњNo, neverвЂќ) вЂњвЂ”so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!вЂќ

вЂњNo, indeed,вЂќ said Alice. вЂњWhat sort of a dance is it?вЂќ

вЂњWhy,вЂќ said the Gryphon, вЂњyou first form into a line along the
sea-shoreвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњTwo lines!вЂќ cried the Mock Turtle. вЂњSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when youвЂ™ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the wayвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњ_That_ generally takes some time,вЂќ interrupted the Gryphon.

вЂњвЂ”you advance twiceвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњEach with a lobster as a partner!вЂќ cried the Gryphon.

вЂњOf course,вЂќ the Mock Turtle said: вЂњadvance twice, set to partnersвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”change lobsters, and retire in same order,вЂќ continued the Gryphon.

вЂњThen, you know,вЂќ the Mock Turtle went on, вЂњyou throw theвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThe lobsters!вЂќ shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

вЂњвЂ”as far out to sea as you canвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSwim after them!вЂќ screamed the Gryphon.

вЂњTurn a somersault in the sea!вЂќ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

вЂњChange lobsters again!вЂќ yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

вЂњBack to land again, and thatвЂ™s all the first figure,вЂќ said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

вЂњIt must be a very pretty dance,вЂќ said Alice timidly.

вЂњWould you like to see a little of it?вЂќ said the Mock Turtle.

вЂњVery much indeed,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњCome, letвЂ™s try the first figure!вЂќ said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. вЂњWe can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?вЂќ

вЂњOh, _you_ sing,вЂќ said the Gryphon. вЂњIвЂ™ve forgotten the words.вЂќ

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:вЂ”

вЂњWill you walk a little faster?вЂќ said a whiting to a snail.
вЂњThereвЂ™s a porpoise close behind us, and heвЂ™s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingleвЂ”will you come and join the dance?
Will you, wonвЂ™t you, will you, wonвЂ™t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wonвЂ™t you, will you, wonвЂ™t you, wonвЂ™t you join the dance?

вЂњYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!вЂќ
But the snail replied вЂњToo far, too far!вЂќ and gave a look askanceвЂ”
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

вЂњWhat matters it how far we go?вЂќ his scaly friend replied.
вЂњThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to FranceвЂ”
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, wonвЂ™t you, will you, wonвЂ™t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wonвЂ™t you, will you, wonвЂ™t you, wonвЂ™t you join the dance?вЂќ


вЂњThank you, itвЂ™s a very interesting dance to watch,вЂќ said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: вЂњand I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!вЂќ

вЂњOh, as to the whiting,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle, вЂњtheyвЂ”youвЂ™ve seen them,
of course?вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњIвЂ™ve often seen them at dinnвЂ”вЂќ she checked herself
hastily.

вЂњI donвЂ™t know where Dinn may be,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle, вЂњbut if youвЂ™ve
seen them so often, of course you know what theyвЂ™re like.вЂќ

вЂњI believe so,вЂќ Alice replied thoughtfully. вЂњThey have their tails in
their mouthsвЂ”and theyвЂ™re all over crumbs.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re wrong about the crumbs,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle: вЂњcrumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
and the reason isвЂ”вЂќ here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.вЂ”вЂњTell her about the reason and all that,вЂќ he said to the Gryphon.

вЂњThe reason is,вЂќ said the Gryphon, вЂњthat they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldnвЂ™t get them out again. ThatвЂ™s all.вЂќ

вЂњThank you,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњitвЂ™s very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.вЂќ

вЂњI can tell you more than that, if you like,вЂќ said the Gryphon. вЂњDo you
know why itвЂ™s called a whiting?вЂќ

вЂњI never thought about it,вЂќ said Alice. вЂњWhy?вЂќ

вЂњ_It does the boots and shoes_,вЂќ the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. вЂњDoes the boots and shoes!вЂќ she repeated
in a wondering tone.

вЂњWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with?вЂќ said the Gryphon. вЂњI mean, what
makes them so shiny?вЂќ

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. вЂњTheyвЂ™re done with blacking, I believe.вЂќ

вЂњBoots and shoes under the sea,вЂќ the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
вЂњare done with a whiting. Now you know.вЂќ

вЂњAnd what are they made of?вЂќ Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

вЂњSoles and eels, of course,вЂќ the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
вЂњany shrimp could have told you that.вЂќ

вЂњIf IвЂ™d been the whiting,вЂќ said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, вЂњIвЂ™d have said to the porpoise, вЂKeep back,
please: we donвЂ™t want _you_ with us!вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњThey were obliged to have him with them,вЂќ the Mock Turtle said: вЂњno
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.вЂќ

вЂњWouldnвЂ™t it really?вЂќ said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

вЂњOf course not,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle: вЂњwhy, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say вЂWith what porpoise?вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњDonвЂ™t you mean вЂpurposeвЂ™?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњI mean what I say,вЂќ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added вЂњCome, letвЂ™s hear some of _your_ adventures.вЂќ

вЂњI could tell you my adventuresвЂ”beginning from this morning,вЂќ said
Alice a little timidly: вЂњbut itвЂ™s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.вЂќ

вЂњExplain all that,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle.

вЂњNo, no! The adventures first,вЂќ said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
вЂњexplanations take such a dreadful time.вЂќ

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating вЂњ_You are old, Father William_,вЂќ to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said вЂњThatвЂ™s very curious.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s all about as curious as it can be,вЂќ said the Gryphon.

вЂњIt all came different!вЂќ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. вЂњI
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.вЂќ He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

вЂњStand up and repeat вЂвЂ™_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,вЂ™вЂќ said the
Gryphon.

вЂњHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!вЂќ
thought Alice; вЂњI might as well be at school at once.вЂќ However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:вЂ”

вЂњвЂ™Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
вЂњYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.вЂќ
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.вЂќ

[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]


вЂњThatвЂ™s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,вЂќ said
the Gryphon.

вЂњWell, I never heard it before,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle; вЂњbut it sounds
uncommon nonsense.вЂќ

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

вЂњI should like to have it explained,вЂќ said the Mock Turtle.

вЂњShe canвЂ™t explain it,вЂќ said the Gryphon hastily. вЂњGo on with the next
verse.вЂќ

вЂњBut about his toes?вЂќ the Mock Turtle persisted. вЂњHow _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s the first position in dancing.вЂќ Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

вЂњGo on with the next verse,вЂќ the Gryphon repeated impatiently: вЂњit
begins вЂ_I passed by his garden_.вЂ™вЂќ

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:вЂ”

вЂњI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pieвЂ”вЂќ

[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquetвЂ”]


вЂњWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,вЂќ the Mock Turtle
interrupted, вЂњif you donвЂ™t explain it as you go on? ItвЂ™s by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!вЂќ

вЂњYes, I think youвЂ™d better leave off,вЂќ said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

вЂњShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?вЂќ the Gryphon
went on. вЂњOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?вЂќ

вЂњOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,вЂќ Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
вЂњHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her вЂ_Turtle Soup_,вЂ™ will you, old
fellow?вЂќ

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:вЂ”

вЂњBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    BeauвЂ”ootiful SooвЂ”oop!
    BeauвЂ”ootiful SooвЂ”oop!
SooвЂ”oop of the eвЂ”eвЂ”evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

вЂњBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    BeauвЂ”ootiful SooвЂ”oop!
    BeauвЂ”ootiful SooвЂ”oop!
SooвЂ”oop of the eвЂ”eвЂ”evening,
    Beautiful, beautiвЂ”FUL SOUP!вЂќ


вЂњChorus again!вЂќ cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of вЂњThe trialвЂ™s beginning!вЂќ was heard in the
distance.

вЂњCome on!вЂќ cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

вЂњWhat trial is it?вЂќ Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered вЂњCome on!вЂќ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:вЂ”

вЂњSooвЂ”oop of the eвЂ”eвЂ”evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!вЂќ




CHAPTER XI.
Who Stole the Tarts?


The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themвЂ”all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themвЂ”вЂњI wish theyвЂ™d
get the trial done,вЂќ she thought, вЂњand hand round the refreshments!вЂќ
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. вЂњThatвЂ™s the judge,вЂќ she said to
herself, вЂњbecause of his great wig.вЂќ

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

вЂњAnd thatвЂ™s the jury-box,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњand those twelve creatures,вЂќ
(she was obliged to say вЂњcreatures,вЂќ you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) вЂњI suppose they are the jurors.вЂќ She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, вЂњjury-menвЂќ
would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. вЂњWhat are
they doing?вЂќ Alice whispered to the Gryphon. вЂњThey canвЂ™t have anything
to put down yet, before the trialвЂ™s begun.вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™re putting down their names,вЂќ the Gryphon whispered in reply,
вЂњfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.вЂќ

вЂњStupid things!вЂќ Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, вЂњSilence in the
court!вЂќ and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down вЂњstupid things!вЂќ on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didnвЂ™t know how to spell
вЂњstupid,вЂќ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. вЂњA nice
muddle their slatesвЂ™ll be in before the trialвЂ™s over!вЂќ thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

вЂњHerald, read the accusation!вЂќ said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:вЂ”

вЂњThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!вЂќ


вЂњConsider your verdict,вЂќ the King said to the jury.

вЂњNot yet, not yet!вЂќ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. вЂњThereвЂ™s a great
deal to come before that!вЂќ

вЂњCall the first witness,вЂќ said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, вЂњFirst witness!вЂќ

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. вЂњI beg pardon, your
Majesty,вЂќ he began, вЂњfor bringing these in: but I hadnвЂ™t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.вЂќ

вЂњYou ought to have finished,вЂќ said the King. вЂњWhen did you begin?вЂќ

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. вЂњFourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was,вЂќ he said.

вЂњFifteenth,вЂќ said the March Hare.

вЂњSixteenth,вЂќ added the Dormouse.

вЂњWrite that down,вЂќ the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

вЂњTake off your hat,вЂќ the King said to the Hatter.

вЂњIt isnвЂ™t mine,вЂќ said the Hatter.

вЂњ_Stolen!_вЂќ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

вЂњI keep them to sell,вЂќ the Hatter added as an explanation; вЂњIвЂ™ve none
of my own. IвЂ™m a hatter.вЂќ

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

вЂњGive your evidence,вЂќ said the King; вЂњand donвЂ™t be nervous, or IвЂ™ll
have you executed on the spot.вЂќ

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

вЂњI wish you wouldnвЂ™t squeeze so.вЂќ said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. вЂњI can hardly breathe.вЂќ

вЂњI canвЂ™t help it,вЂќ said Alice very meekly: вЂњIвЂ™m growing.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ve no right to grow _here_,вЂќ said the Dormouse.

вЂњDonвЂ™t talk nonsense,вЂќ said Alice more boldly: вЂњyou know youвЂ™re growing
too.вЂќ

вЂњYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,вЂќ said the Dormouse: вЂњnot in
that ridiculous fashion.вЂќ And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, вЂњBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!вЂќ
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.

вЂњGive your evidence,вЂќ the King repeated angrily, вЂњor IвЂ™ll have you
executed, whether youвЂ™re nervous or not.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m a poor man, your Majesty,вЂќ the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
вЂњвЂ”and I hadnвЂ™t begun my teaвЂ”not above a week or soвЂ”and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thinвЂ”and the twinkling of the teaвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThe twinkling of the _what?_вЂќ said the King.

вЂњIt _began_ with the tea,вЂќ the Hatter replied.

вЂњOf course twinkling begins with a T!вЂќ said the King sharply. вЂњDo you
take me for a dunce? Go on!вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m a poor man,вЂќ the Hatter went on, вЂњand most things twinkled after
thatвЂ”only the March Hare saidвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI didnвЂ™t!вЂќ the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

вЂњYou did!вЂќ said the Hatter.

вЂњI deny it!вЂќ said the March Hare.

вЂњHe denies it,вЂќ said the King: вЂњleave out that part.вЂќ

вЂњWell, at any rate, the Dormouse saidвЂ”вЂќ the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

вЂњAfter that,вЂќ continued the Hatter, вЂњI cut some more bread-and-butterвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњBut what did the Dormouse say?вЂќ one of the jury asked.

вЂњThat I canвЂ™t remember,вЂќ said the Hatter.

вЂњYou _must_ remember,вЂќ remarked the King, вЂњor IвЂ™ll have you executed.вЂќ

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. вЂњIвЂ™m a poor man, your Majesty,вЂќ he began.

вЂњYouвЂ™re a _very_ poor _speaker_,вЂќ said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

вЂњIвЂ™m glad IвЂ™ve seen that done,вЂќ thought Alice. вЂњIвЂ™ve so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, вЂњThere was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,вЂќ and I never understood what it meant till now.вЂќ

вЂњIf thatвЂ™s all you know about it, you may stand down,вЂќ continued the
King.

вЂњI canвЂ™t go no lower,вЂќ said the Hatter: вЂњIвЂ™m on the floor, as it is.вЂќ

вЂњThen you may _sit_ down,вЂќ the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

вЂњCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!вЂќ thought Alice. вЂњNow we shall get
on better.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d rather finish my tea,вЂќ said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

вЂњYou may go,вЂќ said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

вЂњвЂ”and just take his head off outside,вЂќ the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

вЂњCall the next witness!вЂќ said the King.

The next witness was the DuchessвЂ™s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

вЂњGive your evidence,вЂќ said the King.

вЂњShanвЂ™t,вЂќ said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
вЂњYour Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.вЂќ

вЂњWell, if I must, I must,вЂќ the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, вЂњWhat are tarts made of?вЂќ

вЂњPepper, mostly,вЂќ said the cook.

вЂњTreacle,вЂќ said a sleepy voice behind her.

вЂњCollar that Dormouse,вЂќ the Queen shrieked out. вЂњBehead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!вЂќ

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

вЂњNever mind!вЂќ said the King, with an air of great relief. вЂњCall the
next witness.вЂќ And he added in an undertone to the Queen, вЂњReally, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!вЂќ

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, вЂњвЂ”for they
havenвЂ™t got much evidence _yet_,вЂќ she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name вЂњAlice!вЂќ




CHAPTER XII.
AliceвЂ™s Evidence


вЂњHere!вЂќ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

вЂњOh, I _beg_ your pardon!вЂќ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.

вЂњThe trial cannot proceed,вЂќ said the King in a very grave voice, вЂњuntil
all the jurymen are back in their proper placesвЂ”_all_,вЂќ he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; вЂњnot that it signifies much,вЂќ she
said to herself; вЂњI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.вЂќ

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

вЂњWhat do you know about this business?вЂќ the King said to Alice.

вЂњNothing,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњNothing _whatever?_вЂќ persisted the King.

вЂњNothing whatever,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњThatвЂ™s very important,вЂќ the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: вЂњ_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,вЂќ he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.

вЂњ_Un_important, of course, I meant,вЂќ the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

вЂњimportantвЂ”unimportantвЂ”unimportantвЂ”importantвЂ”вЂќ as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down вЂњimportant,вЂќ and some вЂњunimportant.вЂќ
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
вЂњbut it doesnвЂ™t matter a bit,вЂќ she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out вЂњSilence!вЂќ and read out from his book, вЂњRule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.вЂќ

Everybody looked at Alice.

вЂњ_IвЂ™m_ not a mile high,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњYou are,вЂќ said the King.

вЂњNearly two miles high,вЂќ added the Queen.

вЂњWell, I shanвЂ™t go, at any rate,вЂќ said Alice: вЂњbesides, thatвЂ™s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s the oldest rule in the book,вЂќ said the King.

вЂњThen it ought to be Number One,вЂќ said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. вЂњConsider your
verdict,вЂќ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

вЂњThereвЂ™s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,вЂќ said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; вЂњthis paper has just been
picked up.вЂќ

вЂњWhatвЂ™s in it?вЂќ said the Queen.

вЂњI havenвЂ™t opened it yet,вЂќ said the White Rabbit, вЂњbut it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner toвЂ”to somebody.вЂќ

вЂњIt must have been that,вЂќ said the King, вЂњunless it was written to
nobody, which isnвЂ™t usual, you know.вЂќ

вЂњWho is it directed to?вЂќ said one of the jurymen.

вЂњIt isnвЂ™t directed at all,вЂќ said the White Rabbit; вЂњin fact, thereвЂ™s
nothing written on the _outside_.вЂќ He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added вЂњIt isnвЂ™t a letter, after all: itвЂ™s a set of verses.вЂќ

вЂњAre they in the prisonerвЂ™s handwriting?вЂќ asked another of the jurymen.

вЂњNo, theyвЂ™re not,вЂќ said the White Rabbit, вЂњand thatвЂ™s the queerest
thing about it.вЂќ (The jury all looked puzzled.)

вЂњHe must have imitated somebody elseвЂ™s hand,вЂќ said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

вЂњPlease your Majesty,вЂќ said the Knave, вЂњI didnвЂ™t write it, and they
canвЂ™t prove I did: thereвЂ™s no name signed at the end.вЂќ

вЂњIf you didnвЂ™t sign it,вЂќ said the King, вЂњthat only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else youвЂ™d have signed
your name like an honest man.вЂќ

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

вЂњThat _proves_ his guilt,вЂќ said the Queen.

вЂњIt proves nothing of the sort!вЂќ said Alice. вЂњWhy, you donвЂ™t even know
what theyвЂ™re about!вЂќ

вЂњRead them,вЂќ said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. вЂњWhere shall I begin, please
your Majesty?вЂќ he asked.

вЂњBegin at the beginning,вЂќ the King said gravely, вЂњand go on till you
come to the end: then stop.вЂќ

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:вЂ”

вЂњThey told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

DonвЂ™t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.вЂќ


вЂњThatвЂ™s the most important piece of evidence weвЂ™ve heard yet,вЂќ said the
King, rubbing his hands; вЂњso now let the juryвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњIf any one of them can explain it,вЂќ said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasnвЂ™t a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) вЂњIвЂ™ll give him sixpence. _I_ donвЂ™t believe thereвЂ™s
an atom of meaning in it.вЂќ

The jury all wrote down on their slates, вЂњ_She_ doesnвЂ™t believe thereвЂ™s
an atom of meaning in it,вЂќ but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.

вЂњIf thereвЂ™s no meaning in it,вЂќ said the King, вЂњthat saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we neednвЂ™t try to find any. And yet I donвЂ™t
know,вЂќ he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; вЂњI seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
вЂњвЂ”_said I could not swim_вЂ”вЂќ you canвЂ™t swim, can you?вЂќ he added, turning
to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. вЂњDo I look like it?вЂќ he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

вЂњAll right, so far,вЂќ said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: вЂњвЂ_We know it to be true_вЂ”вЂ™ thatвЂ™s the jury, of
courseвЂ”вЂ_I gave her one, they gave him two_вЂ”вЂ™ why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you knowвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњBut, it goes on вЂ_they all returned from him to you_,вЂ™вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњWhy, there they are!вЂќ said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. вЂњNothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
againвЂ”вЂ_before she had this fit_вЂ”вЂ™ you never had fits, my dear, I
think?вЂќ he said to the Queen.

вЂњNever!вЂќ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.)

вЂњThen the words donвЂ™t _fit_ you,вЂќ said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

вЂњItвЂ™s a pun!вЂќ the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, вЂњLet the jury consider their verdict,вЂќ the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day.

вЂњNo, no!вЂќ said the Queen. вЂњSentence firstвЂ”verdict afterwards.вЂќ

вЂњStuff and nonsense!вЂќ said Alice loudly. вЂњThe idea of having the
sentence first!вЂќ

вЂњHold your tongue!вЂќ said the Queen, turning purple.

вЂњI wonвЂ™t!вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњOff with her head!вЂќ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

вЂњWho cares for you?вЂќ said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
this time.) вЂњYouвЂ™re nothing but a pack of cards!вЂќ

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

вЂњWake up, Alice dear!вЂќ said her sister; вЂњWhy, what a long sleep youвЂ™ve
had!вЂќ

вЂњOh, IвЂ™ve had such a curious dream!вЂќ said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, вЂњIt _was_ a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; itвЂ™s getting late.вЂќ
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.


But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:вЂ”

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hersвЂ”she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyesвЂ”and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sisterвЂ™s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried byвЂ”the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolвЂ”she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to executionвЂ”once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the DuchessвЂ™s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around itвЂ”once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
LizardвЂ™s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull realityвЂ”the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsвЂ”the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the QueenвЂ™s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boyвЂ”and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yardвЂ”while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
TurtleвЂ™s heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

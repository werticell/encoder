CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, вЂњand what is the use of a book,вЂќ thought Alice
вЂњwithout pictures or conversations?вЂќ

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, вЂњOh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!вЂќ (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled вЂњORANGE MARMALADEвЂќ, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

вЂњWell!вЂќ thought Alice to herself, вЂњafter such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyвЂ™ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldnвЂ™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!вЂќ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? вЂњI wonder how
many miles IвЂ™ve fallen by this time?вЂќ she said aloud. вЂњI must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I thinkвЂ”вЂќ (for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) вЂњвЂ”yes, thatвЂ™s about the right distanceвЂ”but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude IвЂ™ve got to?вЂќ (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. вЂњI wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny itвЂ™ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkвЂ”вЂќ (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnвЂ™t sound at all
the right word) вЂњвЂ”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, MaвЂ™am, is this New Zealand or Australia?вЂќ
(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeвЂ”fancy _curtseying_ as youвЂ™re
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) вЂњAnd what
an ignorant little girl sheвЂ™ll think me for asking! No, itвЂ™ll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.вЂќ

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. вЂњDinahвЂ™ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!вЂќ
(Dinah was the cat.) вЂњI hope theyвЂ™ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, IвЂ™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatвЂ™s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?вЂќ And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, вЂњDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?вЂќ and
sometimes, вЂњDo bats eat cats?вЂќ for, you see, as she couldnвЂ™t answer
either question, it didnвЂ™t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
вЂњNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?вЂќ when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, вЂњOh my ears
and whiskers, how late itвЂ™s getting!вЂќ She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and AliceвЂ™s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; вЂњand even if my head would go through,вЂќ thought
poor Alice, вЂњit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.вЂќ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (вЂњwhich certainly was not here
before,вЂќ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words вЂњDRINK ME,вЂќ beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say вЂњDrink me,вЂќ but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. вЂњNo, IвЂ™ll look first,вЂќ she said,
вЂњand see whether itвЂ™s marked вЂ_poison_вЂ™ or notвЂќ; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked вЂњpoison,вЂќ it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked вЂњpoison,вЂќ so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


вЂњWhat a curious feeling!вЂќ said Alice; вЂњI must be shutting up like a
telescope.вЂќ

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; вЂњfor it might end, you know,вЂќ
said Alice to herself, вЂњin my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?вЂќ And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

вЂњCome, thereвЂ™s no use in crying like that!вЂќ said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; вЂњI advise you to leave off this minute!вЂќ She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
вЂњBut itвЂ™s no use now,вЂќ thought poor Alice, вЂњto pretend to be two
people! Why, thereвЂ™s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!вЂќ

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
вЂњEAT MEвЂќ were beautifully marked in currants. вЂњWell, IвЂ™ll eat it,вЂќ said
Alice, вЂњand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way IвЂ™ll
get into the garden, and I donвЂ™t care which happens!вЂќ

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, вЂњWhich way? Which
way?вЂќ, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *




CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears


вЂњCuriouser and curiouser!вЂќ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); вЂњnow IвЂ™m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!вЂќ
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). вЂњOh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? IвЂ™m
sure _I_ shanвЂ™t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;вЂ”but I must be
kind to them,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњor perhaps they wonвЂ™t walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: IвЂ™ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.вЂќ

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. вЂњThey must
go by the carrier,вЂќ she thought; вЂњand how funny itвЂ™ll seem, sending
presents to oneвЂ™s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     _AliceвЂ™s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     AliceвЂ™s love_).

Oh dear, what nonsense IвЂ™m talking!вЂќ

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

вЂњYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњa great girl like
you,вЂќ (she might well say this), вЂњto go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!вЂќ But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, вЂњOh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! wonвЂ™t she be savage if IвЂ™ve kept her waiting!вЂќ Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, вЂњIf you please,
sirвЂ”вЂќ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: вЂњDear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if IвЂ™ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if IвЂ™m not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _thatвЂ™s_ the great puzzle!вЂќ And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

вЂњIвЂ™m sure IвЂ™m not Ada,вЂќ she said, вЂњfor her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesnвЂ™t go in ringlets at all; and IвЂ™m sure I canвЂ™t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _sheвЂ™s_ she, and _IвЂ™m_ I, andвЂ”oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! IвЂ™ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven isвЂ”oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnвЂ™t signify: letвЂ™s try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and RomeвЂ”no, _thatвЂ™s_ all wrong, IвЂ™m certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! IвЂ™ll try and say вЂ_How doth the little_вЂ”вЂ™вЂќ and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do:вЂ”

вЂњHow doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

вЂњHow cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!вЂќ


вЂњIвЂ™m sure those are not the right words,вЂќ said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, вЂњI must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, IвЂ™ve
made up my mind about it; if IвЂ™m Mabel, IвЂ™ll stay down here! ItвЂ™ll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying вЂCome up again, dear!вЂ™
I shall only look up and say вЂWho am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, IвЂ™ll come up: if not, IвЂ™ll stay down
here till IвЂ™m somebody elseвЂ™вЂ”but, oh dear!вЂќ cried Alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, вЂњI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!вЂќ

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the RabbitвЂ™s little white kid gloves while
she was talking. вЂњHow _can_ I have done that?вЂќ she thought. вЂњI must be
growing small again.вЂќ She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

вЂњThat _was_ a narrow escape!вЂќ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; вЂњand
now for the garden!вЂќ and she ran with all speed back to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, вЂњand things are worse than
ever,вЂќ thought the poor child, вЂњfor I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare itвЂ™s too bad, that it is!вЂќ

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, вЂњand in that case I can go back by
railway,вЂќ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

вЂњI wish I hadnвЂ™t cried so much!вЂќ said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. вЂњI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.вЂќ

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

вЂњWould it be of any use, now,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњto speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, thereвЂ™s no harm in trying.вЂќ So she
began: вЂњO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!вЂќ (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brotherвЂ™s Latin Grammar, вЂњA mouseвЂ”of
a mouseвЂ”to a mouseвЂ”a mouseвЂ”O mouse!вЂќ) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

вЂњPerhaps it doesnвЂ™t understand English,вЂќ thought Alice; вЂњI daresay itвЂ™s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.вЂќ (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: вЂњOГ№ est ma chatte?вЂќ which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. вЂњOh, I beg your pardon!вЂќ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animalвЂ™s feelings. вЂњI quite forgot you didnвЂ™t like
cats.вЂќ

вЂњNot like cats!вЂќ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. вЂњWould
_you_ like cats if you were me?вЂќ

вЂњWell, perhaps not,вЂќ said Alice in a soothing tone: вЂњdonвЂ™t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youвЂ™d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,вЂќ Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, вЂњand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her faceвЂ”and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurseвЂ”and sheвЂ™s such a capital one for catching miceвЂ”oh, I beg your
pardon!вЂќ cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. вЂњWe wonвЂ™t talk
about her any more if youвЂ™d rather not.вЂќ

вЂњWe indeed!вЂќ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. вЂњAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! DonвЂ™t let me hear the name
again!вЂќ

вЂњI wonвЂ™t indeed!вЂќ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. вЂњAre youвЂ”are you fondвЂ”ofвЂ”of dogs?вЂќ The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: вЂњThere is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itвЂ™ll fetch things when
you throw them, and itвЂ™ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of thingsвЂ”I canвЂ™t remember half of themвЂ”and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says itвЂ™s so useful, itвЂ™s worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats andвЂ”oh dear!вЂќ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
вЂњIвЂ™m afraid IвЂ™ve offended it again!вЂќ For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, вЂњMouse dear! Do come back again, and we
wonвЂ™t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donвЂ™t like them!вЂќ When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, вЂњLet us get to the shore, and then IвЂ™ll tell you my
history, and youвЂ™ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.вЂќ

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankвЂ”the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, вЂњI am
older than you, and must know better;вЂќ and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, вЂњSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _IвЂ™ll_ soon make
you dry enough!вЂќ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

вЂњAhem!вЂќ said the Mouse with an important air, вЂњare you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! вЂWilliam
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and NorthumbriaвЂ”вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњUgh!вЂќ said the Lory, with a shiver.

вЂњI beg your pardon!вЂќ said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: вЂњDid
you speak?вЂќ

вЂњNot I!вЂќ said the Lory hastily.

вЂњI thought you did,вЂќ said the Mouse. вЂњвЂ”I proceed. вЂEdwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisableвЂ”вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњFound _what_?вЂќ said the Duck.

вЂњFound _it_,вЂќ the Mouse replied rather crossly: вЂњof course you know
what вЂitвЂ™ means.вЂќ

вЂњI know what вЂitвЂ™ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,вЂќ said the
Duck: вЂњitвЂ™s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?вЂќ

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, вЂњвЂвЂ”found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. WilliamвЂ™s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his NormansвЂ”вЂ™ How are you getting on now, my dear?вЂќ it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.

вЂњAs wet as ever,вЂќ said Alice in a melancholy tone: вЂњit doesnвЂ™t seem to
dry me at all.вЂќ

вЂњIn that case,вЂќ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, вЂњI move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remediesвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSpeak English!вЂќ said the Eaglet. вЂњI donвЂ™t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, whatвЂ™s more, I donвЂ™t believe you do either!вЂќ And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

вЂњWhat I was going to say,вЂќ said the Dodo in an offended tone, вЂњwas,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.вЂќ

вЂњWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?вЂќ said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

вЂњWhy,вЂќ said the Dodo, вЂњthe best way to explain it is to do it.вЂќ (And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (вЂњthe exact
shape doesnвЂ™t matter,вЂќ it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no вЂњOne, two, three, and
away,вЂќ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out вЂњThe race is over!вЂќ and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, вЂњBut who has won?вЂќ

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, вЂњ_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.вЂќ

вЂњBut who is to give the prizes?вЂќ quite a chorus of voices asked.

вЂњWhy, _she_, of course,вЂќ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, вЂњPrizes! Prizes!вЂќ

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.

вЂњBut she must have a prize herself, you know,вЂќ said the Mouse.

вЂњOf course,вЂќ the Dodo replied very gravely. вЂњWhat else have you got in
your pocket?вЂќ he went on, turning to Alice.

вЂњOnly a thimble,вЂќ said Alice sadly.

вЂњHand it over here,вЂќ said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying вЂњWe beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;вЂќ and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

вЂњYou promised to tell me your history, you know,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњand why
it is you hateвЂ”C and D,вЂќ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

вЂњMine is a long and a sad tale!вЂќ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

вЂњIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,вЂќ said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the MouseвЂ™s tail; вЂњbut why do you call it sad?вЂќ And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:вЂ”

         вЂњFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, вЂLet us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.вЂ”Come, IвЂ™ll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning IвЂ™ve
         nothing to do.вЂ™ Said the mouse to the cur, вЂSuch a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.вЂ™
         вЂIвЂ™ll be judge, IвЂ™ll be jury,вЂ™ Said cunning old Fury: вЂIвЂ™ll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.вЂ™вЂќ

вЂњYou are not attending!вЂќ said the Mouse to Alice severely. вЂњWhat are
you thinking of?вЂќ

вЂњI beg your pardon,вЂќ said Alice very humbly: вЂњyou had got to the fifth
bend, I think?вЂќ

вЂњI had _not!_вЂќ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

вЂњA knot!вЂќ said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. вЂњOh, do let me help to undo it!вЂќ

вЂњI shall do nothing of the sort,вЂќ said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. вЂњYou insult me by talking such nonsense!вЂќ

вЂњI didnвЂ™t mean it!вЂќ pleaded poor Alice. вЂњBut youвЂ™re so easily offended,
you know!вЂќ

The Mouse only growled in reply.

вЂњPlease come back and finish your story!вЂќ Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, вЂњYes, please do!вЂќ but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

вЂњWhat a pity it wouldnвЂ™t stay!вЂќ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter вЂњAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!вЂќ вЂњHold your tongue, Ma!вЂќ said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. вЂњYouвЂ™re enough to try the patience of an oyster!вЂќ

вЂњI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!вЂќ said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. вЂњSheвЂ™d soon fetch it back!вЂќ

вЂњAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?вЂќ said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
вЂњDinahвЂ™s our cat. And sheвЂ™s such a capital one for catching mice you
canвЂ™t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
sheвЂ™ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!вЂќ

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, вЂњI really must be getting home; the night-air
doesnвЂ™t suit my throat!вЂќ and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, вЂњCome away, my dears! ItвЂ™s high time you were all in
bed!вЂќ On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.

вЂњI wish I hadnвЂ™t mentioned Dinah!вЂќ she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. вЂњNobody seems to like her, down here, and IвЂ™m sure sheвЂ™s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!вЂќ And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself вЂњThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! SheвЂ™ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?вЂќ Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seenвЂ”everything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, вЂњWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!вЂќ And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.

вЂњHe took me for his housemaid,вЂќ she said to herself as she ran. вЂњHow
surprised heвЂ™ll be when he finds out who I am! But IвЂ™d better take him
his fan and glovesвЂ”that is, if I can find them.вЂќ As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name вЂњW. RABBIT,вЂќ engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

вЂњHow queer it seems,вЂќ Alice said to herself, вЂњto be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose DinahвЂ™ll be sending me on messages next!вЂќ And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: вЂњвЂMiss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!вЂ™ вЂComing in a minute,
nurse! But IвЂ™ve got to see that the mouse doesnвЂ™t get out.вЂ™ Only I
donвЂ™t think,вЂќ Alice went on, вЂњthat theyвЂ™d let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!вЂќ

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words вЂњDRINK ME,вЂќ but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. вЂњI know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,вЂќ she said to herself, вЂњwhenever I eat or drink anything; so
IвЂ™ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itвЂ™ll make me grow large
again, for really IвЂ™m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!вЂќ

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself вЂњThatвЂ™s quite enoughвЂ”I hope I shanвЂ™t
grow any moreвЂ”As it is, I canвЂ™t get out at the doorвЂ”I do wish I hadnвЂ™t
drunk quite so much!вЂќ

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself вЂњNow I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?вЂќ

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

вЂњIt was much pleasanter at home,вЂќ thought poor Alice, вЂњwhen one wasnвЂ™t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadnвЂ™t gone down that rabbit-holeвЂ”and yetвЂ”and
yetвЂ”itвЂ™s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, IвЂ™ll write oneвЂ”but IвЂ™m grown up now,вЂќ she added in a
sorrowful tone; вЂњat least thereвЂ™s no room to grow up any more _here_.вЂќ

вЂњBut then,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњshall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? ThatвЂ™ll be a comfort, one wayвЂ”never to be an old womanвЂ”but
thenвЂ”always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnвЂ™t like _that!_вЂќ

вЂњOh, you foolish Alice!вЂќ she answered herself. вЂњHow can you learn
lessons in here? Why, thereвЂ™s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!вЂќ

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

вЂњMary Ann! Mary Ann!вЂќ said the voice. вЂњFetch me my gloves this moment!вЂќ
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and AliceвЂ™s elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself вЂњThen IвЂ™ll
go round and get in at the window.вЂќ

вЂњ_That_ you wonвЂ™t!вЂќ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voiceвЂ”the RabbitвЂ™sвЂ”вЂњPat! Pat! Where are you?вЂќ And
then a voice she had never heard before, вЂњSure then IвЂ™m here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!вЂќ

вЂњDigging for apples, indeed!вЂќ said the Rabbit angrily. вЂњHere! Come and
help me out of _this!_вЂќ (Sounds of more broken glass.)

вЂњNow tell me, Pat, whatвЂ™s that in the window?вЂќ

вЂњSure, itвЂ™s an arm, yer honour!вЂќ (He pronounced it вЂњarrum.вЂќ)

вЂњAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!вЂќ

вЂњSure, it does, yer honour: but itвЂ™s an arm for all that.вЂќ

вЂњWell, itвЂ™s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!вЂќ

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, вЂњSure, I donвЂ™t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!вЂќ вЂњDo as I tell you, you coward!вЂќ and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. вЂњWhat a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!вЂќ thought Alice. вЂњI wonder what
theyвЂ™ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ IвЂ™m sure _I_ donвЂ™t want to stay in here any longer!вЂќ

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: вЂњWhereвЂ™s the other
ladder?вЂ”Why, I hadnвЂ™t to bring but one; BillвЂ™s got the otherвЂ”Bill!
fetch it here, lad!вЂ”Here, put вЂ™em up at this cornerвЂ”No, tie вЂ™em
together firstвЂ”they donвЂ™t reach half high enough yetвЂ”Oh! theyвЂ™ll do
well enough; donвЂ™t be particularвЂ”Here, Bill! catch hold of this
ropeвЂ”Will the roof bear?вЂ”Mind that loose slateвЂ”Oh, itвЂ™s coming down!
Heads below!вЂќ (a loud crash)вЂ”вЂњNow, who did that?вЂ”It was Bill, I
fancyвЂ”WhoвЂ™s to go down the chimney?вЂ”Nay, _I_ shanвЂ™t! _You_ do
it!вЂ”_That_ I wonвЂ™t, then!вЂ”BillвЂ™s to go downвЂ”Here, Bill! the master says
youвЂ™re to go down the chimney!вЂќ

вЂњOh! So BillвЂ™s got to come down the chimney, has he?вЂќ said Alice to
herself. вЂњShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnвЂ™t be in
BillвЂ™s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little!вЂќ

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldnвЂ™t guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself вЂњThis is Bill,вЂќ she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of вЂњThere goes Bill!вЂќ
then the RabbitвЂ™s voice alongвЂ”вЂњCatch him, you by the hedge!вЂќ then
silence, and then another confusion of voicesвЂ”вЂњHold up his headвЂ”Brandy
nowвЂ”DonвЂ™t choke himвЂ”How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!вЂќ

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (вЂњThatвЂ™s Bill,вЂќ thought
Alice,) вЂњWell, I hardly knowвЂ”No more, thank ye; IвЂ™m better nowвЂ”but IвЂ™m
a deal too flustered to tell youвЂ”all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!вЂќ

вЂњSo you did, old fellow!вЂќ said the others.

вЂњWe must burn the house down!вЂќ said the RabbitвЂ™s voice; and Alice
called out as loud as she could, вЂњIf you do, IвЂ™ll set Dinah at you!вЂќ

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, вЂњI
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyвЂ™d take the
roof off.вЂќ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, вЂњA barrowful will do, to begin with.вЂќ

вЂњA barrowful of _what?_вЂќ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. вЂњIвЂ™ll put a stop to
this,вЂќ she said to herself, and shouted out, вЂњYouвЂ™d better not do that
again!вЂќ which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. вЂњIf I eat one of these cakes,вЂќ she thought, вЂњitвЂ™s sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it canвЂ™t possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose.вЂќ

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

вЂњThe first thing IвЂ™ve got to do,вЂќ said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, вЂњis to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.вЂќ

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. вЂњPoor little
thing!вЂќ said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppyвЂ™s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

вЂњAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!вЂќ said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: вЂњI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifвЂ”if IвЂ™d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! IвЂ™d nearly forgotten that
IвЂ™ve got to grow up again! Let me seeвЂ”how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?вЂќ

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything
else.




CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar


The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

вЂњWho are _you?_вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, вЂњIвЂ”I hardly know, sir, just at presentвЂ”at least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.вЂќ

вЂњWhat do you mean by that?вЂќ said the Caterpillar sternly. вЂњExplain
yourself!вЂќ

вЂњI canвЂ™t explain _myself_, IвЂ™m afraid, sir,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњbecause IвЂ™m
not myself, you see.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t see,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњIвЂ™m afraid I canвЂ™t put it more clearly,вЂќ Alice replied very politely,
вЂњfor I canвЂ™t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.вЂќ

вЂњIt isnвЂ™t,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, perhaps you havenвЂ™t found it so yet,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњbut when you
have to turn into a chrysalisвЂ”you will some day, you knowвЂ”and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think youвЂ™ll feel it a little
queer, wonвЂ™t you?вЂќ

вЂњNot a bit,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњall I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.вЂќ

вЂњYou!вЂќ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. вЂњWho are _you?_вЂќ

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the CaterpillarвЂ™s making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, вЂњI
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.вЂќ

вЂњWhy?вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

вЂњCome back!вЂќ the Caterpillar called after her. вЂњIвЂ™ve something
important to say!вЂќ

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

вЂњKeep your temper,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњIs that all?вЂќ said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

вЂњNo,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, вЂњSo you
think youвЂ™re changed, do you?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m afraid I am, sir,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњI canвЂ™t remember things as I
usedвЂ”and I donвЂ™t keep the same size for ten minutes together!вЂќ

вЂњCanвЂ™t remember _what_ things?вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, IвЂ™ve tried to say вЂњHow doth the little busy bee,вЂќ but it all
came different!вЂќ Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

вЂњRepeat, вЂњ_You are old, Father William_,вЂ™вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:вЂ”

вЂњYou are old, Father William,вЂќ the young man said,
    вЂњAnd your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your headвЂ”
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?вЂќ

вЂњIn my youth,вЂќ Father William replied to his son,
    вЂњI feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that IвЂ™m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.вЂќ

вЂњYou are old,вЂќ said the youth, вЂњas I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the doorвЂ”
    Pray, what is the reason of that?вЂќ

вЂњIn my youth,вЂќ said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    вЂњI kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointmentвЂ”one shilling the boxвЂ”
    Allow me to sell you a couple?вЂќ

вЂњYou are old,вЂќ said the youth, вЂњand your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beakвЂ”
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?вЂќ

вЂњIn my youth,вЂќ said his father, вЂњI took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.вЂќ

вЂњYou are old,вЂќ said the youth, вЂњone would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseвЂ”
    What made you so awfully clever?вЂќ

вЂњI have answered three questions, and that is enough,вЂќ
    Said his father; вЂњdonвЂ™t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or IвЂ™ll kick you down stairs!вЂќ


вЂњThat is not said right,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњNot _quite_ right, IвЂ™m afraid,вЂќ said Alice, timidly; вЂњsome of the
words have got altered.вЂќ

вЂњIt is wrong from beginning to end,вЂќ said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

вЂњWhat size do you want to be?вЂќ it asked.

вЂњOh, IвЂ™m not particular as to size,вЂќ Alice hastily replied; вЂњonly one
doesnвЂ™t like changing so often, you know.вЂќ

вЂњI _donвЂ™t_ know,вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

вЂњAre you content now?вЂќ said the Caterpillar.

вЂњWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnвЂ™t
mind,вЂќ said Alice: вЂњthree inches is such a wretched height to be.вЂќ

вЂњIt is a very good height indeed!вЂќ said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

вЂњBut IвЂ™m not used to it!вЂќ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, вЂњI wish the creatures wouldnвЂ™t be so easily
offended!вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ll get used to it in time,вЂќ said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
вЂњOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.вЂќ

вЂњOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_вЂќ thought Alice to
herself.

вЂњOf the mushroom,вЂќ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

вЂњAnd now which is which?вЂќ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


вЂњCome, my headвЂ™s free at last!вЂќ said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

вЂњWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?вЂќ said Alice. вЂњAnd where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I canвЂ™t see you?вЂќ
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

вЂњSerpent!вЂќ screamed the Pigeon.

вЂњIвЂ™m _not_ a serpent!вЂќ said Alice indignantly. вЂњLet me alone!вЂќ

вЂњSerpent, I say again!вЂќ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, вЂњIвЂ™ve tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!вЂќ

вЂњI havenвЂ™t the least idea what youвЂ™re talking about,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњIвЂ™ve tried the roots of trees, and IвЂ™ve tried banks, and IвЂ™ve tried
hedges,вЂќ the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; вЂњbut those
serpents! ThereвЂ™s no pleasing them!вЂќ

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

вЂњAs if it wasnвЂ™t trouble enough hatching the eggs,вЂќ said the Pigeon;
вЂњbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
havenвЂ™t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m very sorry youвЂ™ve been annoyed,вЂќ said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

вЂњAnd just as IвЂ™d taken the highest tree in the wood,вЂќ continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, вЂњand just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!вЂќ

вЂњBut IвЂ™m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!вЂќ said Alice. вЂњIвЂ™m aвЂ”IвЂ™m aвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWell! _What_ are you?вЂќ said the Pigeon. вЂњI can see youвЂ™re trying to
invent something!вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ”IвЂ™m a little girl,вЂќ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

вЂњA likely story indeed!вЂќ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. вЂњIвЂ™ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! YouвЂ™re a serpent; and thereвЂ™s
no use denying it. I suppose youвЂ™ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!вЂќ

вЂњI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,вЂќ said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; вЂњbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t believe it,вЂќ said the Pigeon; вЂњbut if they do, why then
theyвЂ™re a kind of serpent, thatвЂ™s all I can say.вЂќ

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, вЂњYouвЂ™re
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether youвЂ™re a little girl or a serpent?вЂќ

вЂњIt matters a good deal to _me_,вЂќ said Alice hastily; вЂњbut IвЂ™m not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldnвЂ™t want
_yours_: I donвЂ™t like them raw.вЂќ

вЂњWell, be off, then!вЂќ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. вЂњCome, thereвЂ™s half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! IвЂ™m never sure what IвЂ™m
going to be, from one minute to another! However, IвЂ™ve got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenвЂ”how
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?вЂќ As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
вЂњWhoever lives there,вЂќ thought Alice, вЂњitвЂ™ll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!вЂќ So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
woodвЂ”(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)вЂ”and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, вЂњFor the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.вЂќ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, вЂњFrom the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.вЂќ

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

вЂњThereвЂ™s no sort of use in knocking,вЂќ said the Footman, вЂњand that for
two reasons. First, because IвЂ™m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because theyвЂ™re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.вЂќ And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on withinвЂ”a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.

вЂњPlease, then,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњhow am I to get in?вЂќ

вЂњThere might be some sense in your knocking,вЂќ the Footman went on
without attending to her, вЂњif we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know.вЂќ He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. вЂњBut perhaps he canвЂ™t help it,вЂќ
she said to herself; вЂњhis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.вЂ”How am I to get in?вЂќ
she repeated, aloud.

вЂњI shall sit here,вЂќ the Footman remarked, вЂњtill tomorrowвЂ”вЂќ

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the FootmanвЂ™s head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

вЂњвЂ”or next day, maybe,вЂќ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

вЂњHow am I to get in?вЂќ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

вЂњ_Are_ you to get in at all?вЂќ said the Footman. вЂњThatвЂ™s the first
question, you know.вЂќ

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. вЂњItвЂ™s really
dreadful,вЂќ she muttered to herself, вЂњthe way all the creatures argue.
ItвЂ™s enough to drive one crazy!вЂќ

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. вЂњI shall sit here,вЂќ he said, вЂњon and off, for
days and days.вЂќ

вЂњBut what am _I_ to do?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњAnything you like,вЂќ said the Footman, and began whistling.

вЂњOh, thereвЂ™s no use in talking to him,вЂќ said Alice desperately: вЂњheвЂ™s
perfectly idiotic!вЂќ And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

вЂњThereвЂ™s certainly too much pepper in that soup!вЂќ Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a momentвЂ™s pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

вЂњPlease would you tell me,вЂќ said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, вЂњwhy
your cat grins like that?вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s a Cheshire cat,вЂќ said the Duchess, вЂњand thatвЂ™s why. Pig!вЂќ

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:вЂ”

вЂњI didnвЂ™t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didnвЂ™t
know that cats _could_ grin.вЂќ

вЂњThey all can,вЂќ said the Duchess; вЂњand most of вЂ™em do.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t know of any that do,вЂќ Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

вЂњYou donвЂ™t know much,вЂќ said the Duchess; вЂњand thatвЂ™s a fact.вЂќ

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the babyвЂ”the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

вЂњOh, _please_ mind what youвЂ™re doing!вЂќ cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. вЂњOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!вЂќ as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

вЂњIf everybody minded their own business,вЂќ the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, вЂњthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.вЂќ

вЂњWhich would _not_ be an advantage,вЂќ said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. вЂњJust
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axisвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњTalking of axes,вЂќ said the Duchess, вЂњchop off her head!вЂќ

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: вЂњTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? IвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњOh, donвЂ™t bother _me_,вЂќ said the Duchess; вЂњI never could abide
figures!вЂќ And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

вЂњSpeak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.вЂќ


CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):


вЂњWow! wow! wow!вЂќ


While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:вЂ”

вЂњI speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!вЂќ


CHORUS.


вЂњWow! wow! wow!вЂќ


вЂњHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!вЂќ the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. вЂњI must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,вЂќ and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
вЂњjust like a star-fish,вЂќ thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. вЂњIf I donвЂ™t take this child away with me,вЂќ
thought Alice, вЂњtheyвЂ™re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnвЂ™t it be
murder to leave it behind?вЂќ She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
вЂњDonвЂ™t grunt,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњthatвЂ™s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.вЂќ

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. вЂњBut perhaps it was only
sobbing,вЂќ she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.

No, there were no tears. вЂњIf youвЂ™re going to turn into a pig, my dear,вЂќ
said Alice, seriously, вЂњIвЂ™ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!вЂќ The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, вЂњNow, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?вЂќ when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. вЂњIf it had grown up,вЂќ she said to
herself, вЂњit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.вЂќ And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, вЂњif one only knew the right way to change themвЂ”вЂќ when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

вЂњCheshire Puss,вЂќ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. вЂњCome, itвЂ™s pleased so far,вЂќ thought Alice, and she went on.
вЂњWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?вЂќ

вЂњThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,вЂќ said the Cat.

вЂњI donвЂ™t much care whereвЂ”вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњThen it doesnвЂ™t matter which way you go,вЂќ said the Cat.

вЂњвЂ”so long as I get _somewhere_,вЂќ Alice added as an explanation.

вЂњOh, youвЂ™re sure to do that,вЂќ said the Cat, вЂњif you only walk long
enough.вЂќ

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. вЂњWhat sort of people live about here?вЂќ

вЂњIn _that_ direction,вЂќ the Cat said, waving its right paw round, вЂњlives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,вЂќ waving the other paw, вЂњlives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: theyвЂ™re both mad.вЂќ

вЂњBut I donвЂ™t want to go among mad people,вЂќ Alice remarked.

вЂњOh, you canвЂ™t help that,вЂќ said the Cat: вЂњweвЂ™re all mad here. IвЂ™m mad.
YouвЂ™re mad.вЂќ

вЂњHow do you know IвЂ™m mad?вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњYou must be,вЂќ said the Cat, вЂњor you wouldnвЂ™t have come here.вЂќ

Alice didnвЂ™t think that proved it at all; however, she went on вЂњAnd how
do you know that youвЂ™re mad?вЂќ

вЂњTo begin with,вЂќ said the Cat, вЂњa dogвЂ™s not mad. You grant that?вЂќ

вЂњI suppose so,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњWell, then,вЂќ the Cat went on, вЂњyou see, a dog growls when itвЂ™s angry,
and wags its tail when itвЂ™s pleased. Now _I_ growl when IвЂ™m pleased,
and wag my tail when IвЂ™m angry. Therefore IвЂ™m mad.вЂќ

вЂњ_I_ call it purring, not growling,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњCall it what you like,вЂќ said the Cat. вЂњDo you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?вЂќ

вЂњI should like it very much,вЂќ said Alice, вЂњbut I havenвЂ™t been invited
yet.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ll see me there,вЂќ said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

вЂњBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?вЂќ said the Cat. вЂњIвЂ™d nearly
forgotten to ask.вЂќ

вЂњIt turned into a pig,вЂќ Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

вЂњI thought it would,вЂќ said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. вЂњIвЂ™ve seen hatters before,вЂќ she
said to herself; вЂњthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it wonвЂ™t be raving madвЂ”at least not so mad as it
was in March.вЂќ As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

вЂњDid you say pig, or fig?вЂќ said the Cat.

вЂњI said pig,вЂќ replied Alice; вЂњand I wish you wouldnвЂ™t keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.вЂќ

вЂњAll right,вЂќ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

вЂњWell! IвЂ™ve often seen a cat without a grin,вЂќ thought Alice; вЂњbut a
grin without a cat! ItвЂ™s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!вЂќ

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself вЂњSuppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish IвЂ™d gone to see the Hatter instead!вЂќ




CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. вЂњVery
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,вЂќ thought Alice; вЂњonly, as itвЂ™s asleep,
I suppose it doesnвЂ™t mind.вЂќ

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: вЂњNo room! No room!вЂќ they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. вЂњThereвЂ™s _plenty_ of room!вЂќ said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

вЂњHave some wine,вЂќ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
вЂњI donвЂ™t see any wine,вЂќ she remarked.

вЂњThere isnвЂ™t any,вЂќ said the March Hare.

вЂњThen it wasnвЂ™t very civil of you to offer it,вЂќ said Alice angrily.

вЂњIt wasnвЂ™t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,вЂќ said
the March Hare.

вЂњI didnвЂ™t know it was _your_ table,вЂќ said Alice; вЂњitвЂ™s laid for a great
many more than three.вЂќ

вЂњYour hair wants cutting,вЂќ said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.

вЂњYou should learn not to make personal remarks,вЂќ Alice said with some
severity; вЂњitвЂ™s very rude.вЂќ

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was, вЂњWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?вЂќ

вЂњCome, we shall have some fun now!вЂќ thought Alice. вЂњIвЂ™m glad theyвЂ™ve
begun asking riddles.вЂ”I believe I can guess that,вЂќ she added aloud.

вЂњDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?вЂќ said
the March Hare.

вЂњExactly so,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњThen you should say what you mean,вЂќ the March Hare went on.

вЂњI do,вЂќ Alice hastily replied; вЂњat leastвЂ”at least I mean what I
sayвЂ”thatвЂ™s the same thing, you know.вЂќ

вЂњNot the same thing a bit!вЂќ said the Hatter. вЂњYou might just as well
say that вЂI see what I eatвЂ™ is the same thing as вЂI eat what I seeвЂ™!вЂќ

вЂњYou might just as well say,вЂќ added the March Hare, вЂњthat вЂI like what
I getвЂ™ is the same thing as вЂI get what I likeвЂ™!вЂќ

вЂњYou might just as well say,вЂќ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, вЂњthat вЂI breathe when I sleepвЂ™ is the same thing
as вЂI sleep when I breatheвЂ™!вЂќ

вЂњIt _is_ the same thing with you,вЂќ said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasnвЂ™t much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. вЂњWhat day of the month
is it?вЂќ he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said вЂњThe fourth.вЂќ

вЂњTwo days wrong!вЂќ sighed the Hatter. вЂњI told you butter wouldnвЂ™t suit
the works!вЂќ he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

вЂњIt was the _best_ butter,вЂќ the March Hare meekly replied.

вЂњYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,вЂќ the Hatter grumbled:
вЂњyou shouldnвЂ™t have put it in with the bread-knife.вЂќ

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, вЂњIt was the _best_ butter,
you know.вЂќ

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. вЂњWhat a
funny watch!вЂќ she remarked. вЂњIt tells the day of the month, and doesnвЂ™t
tell what oвЂ™clock it is!вЂќ

вЂњWhy should it?вЂќ muttered the Hatter. вЂњDoes _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?вЂќ

вЂњOf course not,вЂќ Alice replied very readily: вЂњbut thatвЂ™s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.вЂќ

вЂњWhich is just the case with _mine_,вЂќ said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The HatterвЂ™s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. вЂњI donвЂ™t quite
understand you,вЂќ she said, as politely as she could.

вЂњThe Dormouse is asleep again,вЂќ said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, вЂњOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.вЂќ

вЂњHave you guessed the riddle yet?вЂќ the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

вЂњNo, I give it up,вЂќ Alice replied: вЂњwhatвЂ™s the answer?вЂќ

вЂњI havenвЂ™t the slightest idea,вЂќ said the Hatter.

вЂњNor I,вЂќ said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. вЂњI think you might do something better with the
time,вЂќ she said, вЂњthan waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.вЂќ

вЂњIf you knew Time as well as I do,вЂќ said the Hatter, вЂњyou wouldnвЂ™t talk
about wasting _it_. ItвЂ™s _him_.вЂќ

вЂњI donвЂ™t know what you mean,вЂќ said Alice.

вЂњOf course you donвЂ™t!вЂќ the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. вЂњI dare say you never even spoke to Time!вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps not,вЂќ Alice cautiously replied: вЂњbut I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.вЂќ

вЂњAh! that accounts for it,вЂќ said the Hatter. вЂњHe wonвЂ™t stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heвЂ™d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oвЂ™clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: youвЂ™d only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!вЂќ

(вЂњI only wish it was,вЂќ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

вЂњThat would be grand, certainly,вЂќ said Alice thoughtfully: вЂњbut thenвЂ”I
shouldnвЂ™t be hungry for it, you know.вЂќ
